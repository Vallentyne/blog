Hey kids.

All jabs aside, this is the Internet people.  I don't want a lawsuit on my hands, so let's keep the full names of any establishments out of the discussion.  Especially discussions involving necrophilia.  Don't be too surprised by what gets indexed where....   [How about that Google cache?](http://www.google.ca/search?q=cache:bjUr-Dl50n8C:www.vallentyne.com/family/+random+ramblings+vallentyne&hl=en&ie=UTF-8)

Anyway, I did decide to upgrade the Blogger account to the Pro version, it's incredibly cheap for what you get in my opinion.  $35US/year ain't a lot of scratch, and there are now some pretty neat features.  You folks can upload pictures right from the Blogger window, so I understand.  That should make things interesting.  There's also a spell checker for Wilson, who can't spell necrophilia.  Also the server is meant to be faster than the free Blogger server.

So, in an effort to keep things above the level of a web-based dissin' match, I also propose that everybody try to contribute something to the blog that is of interest.  A link, a picture, a story, a personal rant, tirade, or even a song, something to keep the folks interested eh?

Also, I think that very soon I will have to think about changing the location of the blog since www.vallentyne.com/family doesn't sound like a place I want necrophiliacs hanging out.  Anyway stay tuned for that.

so.  Comments?  Questions?  Let me know if any of the new features don't work, by the way.
