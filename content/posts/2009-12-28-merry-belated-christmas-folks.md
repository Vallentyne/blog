Rather late on wishing everyone this, but hopefully everyone is having a great holiday. Â Ours was spent in a slothful state, food and drink and sleep and that's just dandy. Â It was the most relaxing and wonderful Christmas we have had, probably ever.

Have a great one, will be posting something again at some point, I'm sure.[![](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/DSC_0109-1024x676.jpg)
