Nikki recently saw an old picture of me where I had experimented with just a moustache, no beard.  Her reaction was immediate and along the lines of "you better not ever have one of those again if you ever want any action". Â  That seems clear enough to me, and in all honesty it didn't look all that good.Â  However, after reflecting a bit, I wonder if her reaction was too hasty?

Of course I have grown a beard every winter for a long time, and Nikki loves the beard.  Obviously the beard and the moustache are very separate things in her mind, despite one being an essential ingredient of the other.  It made me wonder if maybe I didn't give my earlier moustache the proper care and attention that these things deserve.  So, I turned to the web of course and it's rich tapestry of useless information.Â  It turns out there's a lot of moustache-related information out there.Â  Most informative was [this post on Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/67795/How-to-grow-and-maintain-the-perfect-handlebar-moustache).

From that post: a fun video clip about a [Handlebar Moustache Club](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKcH9dXkzR4) in England somewhere.Â  These guys _invented _"loveable curmudgeon".Â  Of course there is also the [afore-mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/06/24/world-beard-moustache-championships/) [World Beard and Moustache Championship](http://www.worldbeardchampionships.com/), which is the pinnacle of hirsute gentlemanly endeavours.Â  Awe-inspiring, to be sure.

I'm thinking that I will live to give the moustache another go, but maybe not until the all of the hair on my head completes it's swan dive to the floor from my scalp.Â  Maybe those lonely hairs on my upper lip will be more welcome then, being the most northerly hair on my skull at that point (well, besides my eyebrows).
