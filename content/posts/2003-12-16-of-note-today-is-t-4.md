Of note:  today is T-4 to the 4th Annual Christmas party.

Don't forget to come with bells on, and also wear clothes.  It's not that kind of party.

Awesome party features include:

- Inspect the basement I have been moaning and pissing about for months on end and wonder what all the fuss was about!  There are at least four cosmetic blemishes that will bother only me, can you spot them?
- Gaze in wonder at the ever growing belly that houses the latest Vallentyne!
- Avoid the swinging "Blue Extension Cord of Death"(tm) on the "Perilous Icy Walkway of Anticipation"(tm)
- Try and decipher what Quinn The Imp is trying to tell you!  Doowah!
- Wonder why do I keep trying to play guitar and sing, when it's painfully obvious I haven't practised either in a whole year?

All this and more on Friday evening, we'll lend you a whole chair, but you'll only use the edge!
