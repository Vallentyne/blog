Before you get scared and depressed about the news of the [foiled terror plot](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/10/us.security/index.html), do yourself a favour and go and watch [yesterday's episode](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/08/081006.html) of The Show.  Ze Frank gives some very sensible dimensions to this news.  It's a good analysis of terrorism, and how we should be reacting to it as a society, which is basically exactly how we aren't reacting to it.  In fact he says that Bush's general sweeping statements more or less reinforce the terror aspect of terrorism and make it more effective as a tactic.  Smart stuff, Ze.

Love that guy.
