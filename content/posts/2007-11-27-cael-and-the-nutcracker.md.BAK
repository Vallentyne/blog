Just a quick note, we decorated the house on Sunday night for Christmas and so it was the usual flurry of storage totes, ornaments, and decorations.Â  Cael found a wooden nutcracker that someone had painted (probably on a Nanny and Poppy craft weekend).Â  I told him it was a nutcracker.Â  The next morning he found it again and was very happy to have found what he called his "woodpecker".Â  I corrected him and he said, oh.Â  He walked away and proudly asked Nikki to "Look at my crackerpecker!"

One of my favourites, for sure.
