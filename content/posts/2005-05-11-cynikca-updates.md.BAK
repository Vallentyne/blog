Well, I'm sure you will understand if I use this space to promote Nikki and Cindy's business.  The disclaimer is that of course I sleep with one of Cynik.ca's partners.  Yes, it's Nikki, don't get your knickers in a knot.

Anyway, Nik has been very busily taking pictures of the new pieces she and Cindy have been making over the past while and most of them are now available on the site for your perusal.  So, have a look and see what you like.  If you are interested in anything note the name of the piece and send a message to inquiries@cynik.ca.  There are still no prices on the site, but they will get back to you right away with that kind of info.  

So, go check it out.
