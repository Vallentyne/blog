An article this morning [from Reuters](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/10/12/canada.troops.marijuana.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories), Canadian troops in Afghanistan are having trouble rooting out Taliban militants from a huge forest of 10 foot tall marijuana plants.Â  It is resistant to thermal imaging and incredibly dense and so is proving difficult to successfully navigate safely.Â  In a turn that came from a plot-line on [Trailer Park Boys](http://www.tpbmovie.com/), the military even tried to burn the marijuana forest, but the, ah, down wind troops (one pictures hasty "Stripes"-like maneuvers of all the troops in the area to be suddenly down wind from this operation) experienced some "ill effects".Â  Well duh.Â  It's amazing that this killer Afghan weed is so potent it doesn't actually burn very well.

Man, that's some sweet dope, eh?Â  Not only can you smoke it, but you can hide your whole army in it.Â  It's impervious to fire, thermal imaging, is there anything marijuana can't do?Â  We should plant vast acres of this stuff in Canada, just in case we get invaded at some point.Â  Oh, we actually probably have already done that here and there.
