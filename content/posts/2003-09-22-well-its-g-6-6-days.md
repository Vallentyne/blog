Well, it's G-6 (6 days to Garage sale) and things are picking up steam nicely.  Jordy will be making some signs this week, and the sorting and the pricing continue unchecked.

Also, basement renovations made some progress on the weekend.  I was able to get the strapping on the ceiling this weekend myself, but there really wasn't any fine art to it, thankfully.  I have been following the directions of head foreman and Neighbour Nick, and things are progressing nicely.  Thank god he's on the job and works cheap, or I'd be screwed.  This week we are due to frame in a closet and maybe start on a bulkhead or two.  It's all good basic carpentry, and I'm absolutely useless at it.

Let's see, Good Neighbour Jim and his team of racers landed a 6th place finish in the Canadian Nationals this past weekend.  Not too shabby, at all.  Well done Jim.  I even noticed a few quotes on the website from said Neighbour.  When you take that into account with the ever-present cell phone chatter, I think that soon "Good Neighbour Jim" will be earning a new moniker.  I'm leaning heavily towards "Hollywood"  or possibly "Beverly Hills".  "Jim-erly Hills" isn't bad, in a pinch.

I will ponder this some more, and let you know later.
