Thank heavens the US Congress is really taking this whole childhood obesity problem seriously, and will soon be passing some laws to make sure that kids eat more vegetables.Â  The solution was embarrassingly easy, and they can't believe they didn't think of it before now:Â  Write a little law, and bam, pizza IS a vegetable!Â  Done.Â  I'm sure that failing to resist those lobbying corporations that keep you all fat will have no adverse financial consequences later on, like health care.

Good job!
