Interesting article Robbie.  Somebody should put a leash on that guy.

In my own way I find that I can't worry any more about war-time life, it's too much.  I can still shake my head in amazement at Bush and the Gang, but there's only so much I can absorb without going numb.  I did notice that Noonan's blog (Mr. Uppity Pants) does cover a lot of excellent stuff [www.seedsandstems.blogspot.com](http://www.seedsandstems.blogspot.com) (I wonder what that blog name reefers to?)  There's some really good reading there.  Nice job, James and company.
I don't think that Random Ramblings will be much competition in the way of thoughtful insight or political views, it's more like the Prozac of blogs.  It's more of a fun diversion than a subversive counter-media centre.
