So, it's a slow day here at work.  I'm so bored I can't even whip up enough mental activity to post something funny.  It's not that I don't have anything to do, it's more of a general sense of it really won't matter if I did it or not that keeps me from getting around to doing anything at all.




I have successfully avoided watching more than one whole minute of the Olympics so far.  I like hearing that we have done well, but for my money the Winter Olympics is a lot more spectator friendly.  You have hockey which usually gets fun to watch at the Olympics, luge which is beyond comprehension, biathlon or whatever that ski and shoot thing is called, and the ski jumping.  It's all about the truly spectacular crashes, isn't it? 




Those luge guys are nuts.  I really can't figure out the logic behind their equipment.  Let's follow the reasoning, shall we?




1. Hm, ok so I want to go really fast downhill.  Check.  Let's get icy tube fastened to a mountain, how about like those bobsled dudes have?  They are wimps anyway, riding in an enclosed car.  

2. I don't want to get hurt, that would be bad.  I'd better put a helmet on.  Check.  

3. I hate it when snow gets up your pantleg, it's all cold and wet, eww.  Let's just use some Dupont Exterior Latex and paint pants right on my legs, that'll fix that problem.  Check.  

4. Since I'm riding down the mountain naked, but with a helmet on, I had better ride feet-first.  That way the only piece of protection I'm wearing is pointing away from the direction I'm travelling.  Good idea.




Yep.  At least those skeleton guys get it right.  If you're going to rocket down a mountain at 85 mph, at least do it headfirst for God's sake.
