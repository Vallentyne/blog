A puzzling story out of Pakistan, apparently they hate kites there so badly they arrested over 1000 people for kite flying at a recent kite-flying festival (go figure the crafty detective work there).  Apparently this just isn't "the man" stomping on some light-hearted fun, these are some hard-core nasty kite flyers.  The police report that some 500 people are injured yearly during this kite festival:


<blockquote>"...from sharp kite strings and others from stray bullets or pellets fired into the air to celebrate the festival."</blockquote>


Yes, apparently these guys use metal and glass coated strings to have kite dogfights and cut each other's strings, pretty and nasty.  Apparently 7 people died last year from string lacerations.  Wow, these kite guys mean business.  I can't help but think that they would be left alone if they sort of refrained from the kite skeet shoot part of the celebration.
