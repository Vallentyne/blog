Quick one.

Johnny Cash, American Recordings.  Go buy this record.  It was recorded in 1994, 10 years before he died and it sounds incredible.  It's just him and a guitar.  I'm blown away by it.

I'm also reading "Shakey" which is a biography of Neil Young.  Quite the ride, more on that later.

That's it.
