Happy New Year folks...

It's the first post of 2005, it's a very auspicious (that's a word which in this case means I have been subscribing to the [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com) word of the day) event.  So, I thought I would post some New Year's resolutions.  It's still in fashion to take up time around January 1 to talk about last year and make guesses about the upcoming year, for some reason.  You would think we would get tired of it sometime.

My New Year's Resolutions
1. Get some exercise, any kind will be fine.  When a 9 year old boy (albeit a very very fit 9 year old boy who absolutely lives on hockey skates) can easily outstrip me on the rink, it's high time to get into some sort of shape.  Watch your back, Tristan, I'm puffing very very slowly up behind you.
2. Stop eating out of habit.  See number 1.  I'm Pavlov's bitch when it comes to habitual eating.  At 9pm when the kids are in bed, I'm munching away like a heifer, no matter what I'm doing at the time.  I try to control the chip intake with popcorn, but there's only so much I can do.  I should try to make a Humpty Dumpty patch so I can still absorb grease and salt without the oral fixation.  I'll have to put that on a "To-Do List".
3. Quit procrastinating.  I'm very very good at this.  I'm so good my conscious mind isn't even aware of it most of the time.  I'm doing it right now, writing this when I should be working, for crying out loud.
4. Make more time for the family.  No jokes here, that's an honest one.

That's the short list.

Ridiculous posts to follow.
