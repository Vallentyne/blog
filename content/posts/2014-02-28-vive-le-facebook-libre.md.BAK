As an English speaking resident of Ontario I will admit I chuckledÂ when I read [this attempt ](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/facebook-exempt-from-quebec-s-french-language-law-lawyer-says-1.2554859)by the Quebec language police to control what a business owner's Facebook page says or doesn't say.Â  Language laws make no sense to me in any way, it seems to me that they only serve to make it more difficult for Quebec businesses to compete, but this particular attempt could make a bigger news splash.Â  It probably won't result in a positive image for the Quebec government, either.

It's important to note that I am not an educated commenter on this matter, nor does it matter one bit to me either way what happens.

This will be an interesting one to follow, since there are lots of fun things that may come to light.Â  Somebody, somewhere is going to ask the question:Â  well where are Facebook's servers?Â  And then the fun will begin again....
