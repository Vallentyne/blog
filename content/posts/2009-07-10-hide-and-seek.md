I like this one from Pennsylvania: a family game of hide and seek results in [the parents calling the police](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hK2wD9SsyIy1xuGR56ve2CbHjTbAD99AUO300) to help them find their toddler.Â  I predict an exciting young adulthood for this family when their 2 year old can cause that kind of trouble.

The best part of the whole story?Â  Even the cops and fire department couldn't find the kid, it was the family dog that ratted her out, sleeping under the washing machine.Â  Awesome.

I can say that Lloyd's nose is easily three times as sensitive as Harvey's, he can smell when my brain neurons start considering making my body go and get him a treat before it even happens.Â  A snoring two year old under a washing machine?Â  Not even a challenge.
