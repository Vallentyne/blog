As the weather improves the house is quickly sliding into summer mode; yard work, playing outside with the kids, etc.  The kids inflatable pool is an even bigger hit this year with the boys than it was last year.  Lots of yelling and splashing, etc.  Jordy still gets into it too, but in a slightly more reserved, tween way of course.

Nik and I have noticed that all of the kids have turned a corner each in their own way just in the last few weeks.  It's funny how they do that on you; they stay the same for a long time and then all at once get older.  The lads are getting along a lot better together now than ever before, and are much more likely to listen to us, which of course makes our lives a little easier.  As a testament to that (no pun intended) we have started going back to church from time to time.  Everybody has been really good about being quiet and behaving.  Cael provided the entertainment this week.  The homily was getting rather passionate and Cael was (uncharacteristically) watching the priest, riveted by the fiery delivery.  He turned around with his eyes as big as dinner plates and in a stage whisper that was timed perfectly into a lull in the background noise said to me:  "That guy's yellin'!  SHHHH! Quiet!"  I'm sure that I can't convey the outrage in his voice here, but he was aghast that the priest was getting away with making noise when he was not allowed.  

Good times....
