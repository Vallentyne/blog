Subtle shot there, Vallentyne, but not something a faithful, regular blog reader would miss.

Anyway, YES, the Halloween party is tomorrow and preparations have been in full swing at my place. Costume ideas have swirled madly but I've finally settled on mine and have a full 24 hours or so left to make it happen. Thankfully the decorating is done, and I've taken the booze inventory so I just have one stop left for that.

It should be a lot of fun---really looking forward to seeing everyone there!
