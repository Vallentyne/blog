An interesting article on The Guardian about how healthy brands are crushing sales of less-healthy foods in the UK.  The topic of the article is Sunny Delight, which is also available in Canada and the US.  I think of it as an acidic orange flavoured syrup myself, but apparently it was once the third largest selling drink there.  Anyway, the article came to my attention in part because of my [renewed interest](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/12/blogiday.html) in my own health.  I haven't exactly changed my eating habits altogether, but I can't be sure that Nikki isn't snickering at me behind my back.  My efforts to eat slightly better amount to little more than trying to eat a few less chips, I admit.  It's a very feeble effort.  I look at my exercise regime as a mandatory tax in order to support my eating habits into the future, paid against my flagging metabolism.  Here's hoping there's no deficit.
