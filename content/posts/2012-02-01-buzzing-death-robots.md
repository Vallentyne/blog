The guys that work soo hard on stuff like this today are the engineers of tomorrow's armageddon.Â  Seriously.Â  Did you have to work quite so hard on the menacing re-formation bit when flying through a window?Â  I mean seriously, just add some scenery and a grimy, frightened rebel fighter crouching under the window clutching his gunÂ and you have the sizzler reel for a really good science fiction movie.Â  Why do we need this?Â  Will we all even live long enough to regret this?

Yes, it's still unspeakably cool.
