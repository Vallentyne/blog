Ever since I saw that cold medicine commercial (Triaminic? can't remember) where they have a baby's head on a man's body I have had a slightly squeamish reaction to this sort of thing.Â  I have no idea what it is about seeing these images that makes some part of my brain start screaming and gibbering with insanity.Â  It's just wrong on some sort of visceral level that I can't understand, indeed if I examine it too closely I teeter on the edge of losing it completely.Â  So with that bit of (too much) information I give you an entire web site dedicated to this freakish phenomenon: [manbabies.com](http://manbabies.com)

Most are lame hack jobs that don't cause any problems at all, but some are genuinely good and therefore are bad.

Enjoy.Â  Thanks [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/05/07/manbabies/).
