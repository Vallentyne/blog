On Saturday Quinn had a hockey game, and they lost 3-2.Â  He wasn't too worried about it, they just have too much fun playing to get all that worked up over it.Â  We were walking out of the rink and I said to Quinn, 'well don't worry buddy, you can't win them all'.Â  His response?

"No, but you CAN lose them all."

After I stopped laughing, I started thinking that this was actually fairly profound.Â  In the grand sense, any "win" should be a reason to celebrate.Â  We should be grateful for what we have, in essence.Â  It can always be worse.

As I prepare to work again this weekend (which is 4 out of the last 5 weekends in a row) it is rather important to remember that it's better to be working hard than hardly working.

Thanks buddy, I needed that.
