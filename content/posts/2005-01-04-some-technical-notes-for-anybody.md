Some technical notes for anybody who cares.

Do some things for yourself and your PC:
1. Make sure you are running Windows XP service pack 2.  Or buy a Mac, as I've been threatening to do for a while now.
2. Don't use Internet Explorer, use [Mozilla Firefox](http://mozilla.org).
3. Try [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com).

The first two are for security's sake.  The last is just for fun.
