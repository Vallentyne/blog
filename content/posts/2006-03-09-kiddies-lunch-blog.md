In the normal scope of things, I make lunches for Jordy and I every day.  Usually this happens at around 9pm or later, after the nightly battle for the bedtime.  By this point I am well worn; resembling a round-shouldered, shuffling, bleary zombie.  So my [approach to making lunches](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/02/note_to_self.html) is more or less as a chore, or an obstacle standing between me and some much needed down-time with my vivacious wife.  So, they are hastily thrown-together things without any imagination, resulting in a bag containing a chewing exercise, a life-sustaining one mind you, but a joyless eating experience nonetheless.

I didn't always think this way.  It used to be different.  Like 10 minutes ago when I didn't know anything about [this blog](http://veganlunchbox.blogspot.com/).  It's a mom's day-by-day account of the vegan lunches she packs for her son, with pictures and recipes.  The amount of passion, planning and work that goes into these lunches is nothing short of incredible.  I feel lunch-bag inadequacy.  My talents are so dwarfed by this woman, I'm barely fit to have children.  Yes, they are all still alive, but just barely, right?

Anyway, I'm in awe.  Very very impressive that there is even one person on this planet that is this well nourished.
