Some products lend themselves to jests more than others, for sure.  This would be one of those.  [The Daddle](http://www.cashelcompany.com/dad.php), as it is known, is a Dad-saddle for children.  Why this is necessary it certainly a good question, since all of my children have been riding my back for years now.  Bareback, as it were.  I'm broken in already, bridle not required.  Apparently I still need to be kicked now and again to get moving...

I think that pretty much exhausts the lame jokes about me and this silly thing.
