The best piece of writing I scanned today came from [Where is Bob?](http://whereisbob.wordpress.com/) which may or may not be a fake, but is definitely a fun read.Â  The gist is that Bob is an unpleasant manager who is always away from the office, and lies pathologically about it.Â  I highly recommend you start at [the beginning](http://whereisbob.wordpress.com/2008/08/06/three-long-months/) and read from there, there are only a few posts to catch up on.Â  It had me laugh out loud a few times.
