The world of toys never ceases to amaze me.  Mattel has released a new Barbie in India.  Here's some details:


<blockquote>"Toymaker Mattel has launched a Barbie doll in India, impeccably dressed as always, but also with her own must-have accessory - a mobile phone. But this is no toy - the mobile works. Barbie's owners can Instant Message Barbie and friends who have a Barbie too. Plus the look of the phone can be changed to match her clothes. It's priced at R 1199 (USD 26)."</blockquote>


Wow.  Now that's craptastic.  What does the service plan for the doll cost from the mobile carrier?  Not only do you need batteries, but airtime?
