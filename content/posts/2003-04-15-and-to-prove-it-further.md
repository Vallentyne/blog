And to prove it further, check out Ricky in this warm and fuzzy family movie, prior to the TPB show (presumably).  The trailer is here, and you have to be quick because he's not there long, but his one line is something like "They're coming" and he looks remarkably Ricky-like.  Julian is in this movie too, but he doesn't appear in the trailer.  Ironic that it's a TRAILER, don't you think?

Here's the link, it's [the good old IMDB.](http://us.imdb.com/Trailers?0307639&screenplay&E17037&9&2)

Hah.  Don't ask me why I took the time to find this alright?

Perhaps if we have the time we will try to rent this little flick for Sunday to see how warm and fuzzy the boys are in the "family oriented" genre.
