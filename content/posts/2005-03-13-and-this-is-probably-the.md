And this is probably the last post in this train of consciousness for now, I think I'm going to go and spend some time with Nikki, cause she rocks.




Apparently they are having [a heck of a time](http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,66696,00.html) getting some old TV shows released on DVD because the greedy record companies won't permit the music included in the shows to be re-released without the TV studios paying for the music again.  The obvious example is WKRP in Cincinatti, and that's just a crying shame beause that's one of my most favourite shows.  But it of course includes a whole bunch of good music that now can't be included with the DVD releases because it would be way too expensive to do that.  The TV studios are forced to either change the music or not release the thing.  Either way the fans lose and aren't happy, and nobody hears the music.
