This video is hypnotic and amazing.Â  You can easily imagine these helpful benign robot helpers doing amazing things to help humans.Â  You can just as easily imagine them busily wrapping your struggling form with numerous thin unbreakable nylon ropes....Â  but maybe I have seen too many action movies.Â  Still, way cool tech and a clear sign of things to come.
