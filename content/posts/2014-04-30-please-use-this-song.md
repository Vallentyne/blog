If you haven't seen any of [John Lajoie's ](http://www.jonlajoie.com/)stuff Â before, be sure to go in with your thick skin on, since he doesn't pull many punches in the name of comedy, but his latest song is absolutely fantastic and almost mass market friendly.Â  On purpose.

The consumerism nod is bang on, and so is the sly music industry snark.Â  I like it, and like all good things, it's catchy as hell.Â  Remind me to tell you about the time I saw him in Ottawa and woke up with powder for a kneecap....
