If you think about it, Cael's growth isn't that strange.  The size of my head has long been a source of amusement for everyone.  It's large, make no mistake. It always catches people off guard because I'm not that big a person otherwise.  Here's an alternative theory.  Maybe my head is the right size, it's just that I have a freakishly small body.  If my body had grown to my head's potential I would be  in the NBA right now.  Or in a circus.

So, Cael is probably just going to be fine.  Carnies take care of their own, after all.
