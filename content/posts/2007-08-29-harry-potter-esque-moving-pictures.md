I'm sure there's a frigging boatload of technology behind this company, and it's a fairly [neat idea](http://www.motionportrait.com/e/about/), but I can't help but think of the moving photographs described in the Harry Potter books when I see this [in action](http://www.motionportrait.com/e/about/demo_faith_02.html).

Not to mention that's it's kind of creepy (no, really creepy), I'm having a hard time imagining this taking off in any real way.Â  Watching that image track my mouse with those bloodshot eyeballs and then smile is a bit too much.

Predictably, I saw this on [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/64187/MotionPortrait).
