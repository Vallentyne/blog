A teenager lost control of her SUV and plowed into a tree on a gravel road.  The tree also happened to house "tens of thousands of bees", which then [completely enveloped the truck](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/03/bees.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories).  Firefighters had to hose the bees down to get her out.

I guess she'll bee more careful from now on...

I kill me.
