Not to cash in on any recent publicity about a [certain upcoming movie](http://www.apple.com/trailers/mgm/the_pink_panther/), but this is really [just too funny](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/01/30/britain.museum.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories).

A guy was touring a museum in England, tripped on his untied shoelace, fell down a flight of stairs and smashed 3 priceless vases.

Oh man.

A choice quote was provided:



<blockquote>"They are in very, very small pieces, but we are determined to put them back together."  The museum declined to say what the vases were worth. </blockquote>
