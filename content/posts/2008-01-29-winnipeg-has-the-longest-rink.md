When I saw the cover of Sunday's Ottawa Sun I knew I had to write something about it.Â  After all, we just finished [trashing Mexico's longest skating conga line](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/10/skate-record-in-mexico-city-pah/) here and now we have Winnipeg's claim that [they have the longest skating rink in the world](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/01/27/pf-4796464.html) to contend with.

Well it's not even a real problem, since it turns out Winnipeg's longest skating rink amounts to basically an icy path, and not really a rink at all.Â  It's embarrassing for them, really.Â  We can relax since I sincerely doubt that many people will flock there to shuffle along Winnipeg'sÂ "longest rink". It is longer I suppose, but it's only 10 feet wide, which if you have actually been on the Canal is laughable at best.Â  You would be constantly dodging people and getting tied up in traffic.Â  How many simultaneousÂ hockey games can they play on it?Â  Not even one, while we could probably realistically manage 50 or more, with room to spare for beer gardens (which in hindsight is probably a bad idea, serving alcohol on an ice surface).Â  I would liken their "skating trail" to connecting to the Internet via dialup.Â  Sure you are technically skating, but it's slow and definitely isn't any fun.

Winnipeg may have a longer rink, but as we all know more bandwidth is alwaysÂ better.Â  Anybody else agree?
