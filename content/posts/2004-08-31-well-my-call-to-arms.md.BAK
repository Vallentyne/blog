Well my call to arms for the content brigade has resulted in one comment from Andrea and a rather bitter comment from an anonymous poster. At 6:57am. When there's only two people I know who would be anywhere near a computer at that hour, and they both live together. I'm not naming any names, though. Or it could be someone I don't know I suppose, it is the Internet. I can't imagine how this site would attract anyone that didn't know us in the first place.

Here's something new.  It's a paper on [The Monetary Economics of Thurston Howell III.](http://mises.org/fullstory.aspx?control=1595) Yes, from Gilligan's Island. It's a relatively real paper on economics, using Gilligan's Island as an example. I find it strangely compelling in it's arguments, perhaps mostly because I identify so closely with it's subject matter. Anyway, for an economics paper, it's a pretty good read.
