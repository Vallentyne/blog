He sold his soul to the devil, there's no other explanation for what this guy can do with a deck of cards.Â  This makes what I do when I shuffle cards look like smashing them with a big rock.Â  Several things come to mind:



	  * never play cards with this guy
	  * he needs to get out more, or needs to stay home more, can't decide which
	  * holy wow

Enjoy:
