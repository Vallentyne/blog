Ok!  This should prove more interesting.  For those of you just noticing that the Vallentyne Family web site looks different, well good for you.  It does look different.  It has been Bloggerized.  This is wayyy cool stuff that makes it easier (in theory) to post to the website and keep you up to date.  Follow the button at the bottom to find out more.  It's geeky, and so, of course very cool.

Also, Nikki can post to the site and keep things on the level.  I have been very selfish up to now with the web site posting, and have never shown her how to do it.  It also makes things more fun when nobody gets a word in edgewise.

I will hopefully get some better navigation back to the photo galleries going soon, but for those of you that can't wait, the link to the old galleries for friends is [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/family/friends%20photo.htm), and the link to the old family gallery is [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/family/family%20photo.htm)

There.  That should keep you going for a while.  Not that there is anything good to read here yet.  Happy New Year, by the way.  Oh, and as always, complaints/suggestions/inquiries should go here:  [inquiries@vallentyne.com](mailto:inquiries@vallentyne.com)  Maybe I might do something if you suggest it.  Maybe.
