This one in particular is appropriate for these wintry nights, this reading by Johnny Cash makes it really come alive.Â  An old favourite I shared with the kids tonight.

I saw this on Facebook, shared by John S.Â  Really, really fantastic.

Also, I am officially an old fart.Â  Get off my snowbank.
