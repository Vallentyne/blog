Even though this whole foot thing is getting weirder by the minute, I feel compelled to continue to report it here.Â  It's part of my commitment to a story, I guess.

Seriously though, how strange is it that this keeps happening?Â  What kind of a coincidence is it?Â  If it is a coincidence, that is.

The [FIFTH foot came ashore](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/06/16/5897446-cp.html) this week.Â  It's the first left one, making my [prediction true](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/05/26/the-other-shoe-has-dropped/), and hokey pokeying will commence soon.

Even stranger, some prankster dropped a sixth foot that turned out to [be a fake](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/06/19/5928016-24hvan.html).Â  It's a strange world when somebody wants to get in on all the misplaced body parts action.
