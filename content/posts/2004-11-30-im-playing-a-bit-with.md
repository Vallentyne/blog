I'm playing a bit with a new service, it's Flickr and it's very geeky and very cool.  As you may notice, Cael is gracing this page at the right, in all his glory.

There's so much to learn about this application, I'm totally impressed by it.  For instance, click on Cael and see it on the Flickr site.  You would then be able to look at all of the pictures I put up there, and look at the tags and labels I put on them.  I'm going to play with it a little bit and see what I can do.  It might be fun...
