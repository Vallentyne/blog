Well I'm ashamed to say that I will often hear my sweet children say things that I PROMISE myself not to forget, and yet the rub is that if you have sweet (and small) children, you will most certainly forget no matter what you do.  They have a real knack for distracting you from retaining anything in your short term memory.  I lose too many gems from my memory in a day, and I'd give anything to be able to bottle it all, or at least retain it long enough to blog about it.  Ah, I digress.

Today however, there was a little gem that I DID manage to remember.  It gave me a warm fuzzy that will no doubt linger long after today.  We were on our way to the library in the van when Quinn and I had the following conversation:

Q- Mom, 
Me- Yes Quinn
Q- Are our hearts God's night lights?
Me- Wow, what a neat thing to say.  Did you learn that at school?
Q- No.
Me-Did you hear someone say that?
Q- No. I just thought it up in my head.
Me-Well that is really awesome. What made you think of that?
Q- Well, at school in English class we sing this song every morning and it says "with glowing hearts, we see thee rise" and so I thought it meant that our hearts were God's night lights
Me (Stunned) - Well Quinn, I think you are onto something there, and I completely agree with you that our hearts ARE in FACT God's night lights.

There's patriotism through a child's eyes for you.

On that note, it is late and I bid you all a peaceful sleep.  May God's night lights cast upon you the warm fuzzy they will now forever give me.

Good Night,
Nik
