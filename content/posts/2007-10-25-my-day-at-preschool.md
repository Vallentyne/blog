Well, today was my first duty day of the year.  I missed my first one due to Quinners having a bug, but today Cael and I got to go without any problem.  This year is considerably structured in comparison to last year.  I will say that I saw a side of Cael that only an environment like that could have unveiled.  We were sitting at circle time and Cael was asked to be first to stand in circle so we could sing about his clothes for "black and orange" day today.  We all sang and he just stood there.  (You're supposed to jump while others sing for you.)  Then he stopped and said, "Miss Shelley, you forgot my mother."  Well that just wouldn't do so we did it all again with mom in the middle jumping too.  Very sweet.  Then we went around the circle and sang, "My name is...." and the child is supposed to sing his/her name.  Well after Cael was done, he interupted the whole song for the next person to tell Miss Shelley, "You forgot my mother!"  Poor Miss Shelley. She was so sweet about it all.  Nothing could happen without including me.  It was "our" day at preschool, and I was like a preschooler in his eyes, rather than a duty person.  You can imagine the melted puddle I was after the sweet and adorable consideration Cael gave to me.

When the whole 22 kids, teachers, and duty parents went out to play in the leaves I had this "Ahhh that's so cute" moment while I watched Cael hold the hand of one of the pretty little twins in his class.  Then when we got there, he was holding the hand of the other pretty little twin.  As we were walking back into the school, he was holding BOTH their hands.  Then all of a sudden this sweet little girl (not one of the twins) came running up to me and wrapped her arms around my legs crying.  One of the teachers seemed to know the problem and scooped her up and said to me, "She's upset with the twins."  Turns out she wanted to be holding Cael's hand too.   Her mom arrived then while the tears were falling and she locked eyes with me.  I just looked at her and said, "Oh, I'm so sorry!"  What gives man! Who does Cael think he is anyway... Austin Powers?  He's moving and shakin' at the preschool.  Lord help us when he gets older.  I said to one of the teachers, "It may seem that there will need to be some sit-down discussions happening at our house!"  I kid I kid, but how heartbreaking for this little one that is trying to compete with twins...I mean really, Cael.

I do wonder how much of this is foreshadowing the future.....
