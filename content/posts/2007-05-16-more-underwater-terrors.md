Following on top of the [diving tigers](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/05/15/underwater-tigers/) from yesterday, this time we have some seriously [funky and creepy creatures](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/nouvian/nouvian_gallery.html) from much much deeper than a couple of feet.Â  There are [living](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/nouvian/galleryimages/Widder_Stomias_72.JPG) [nightmares](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/nouvian/galleryimages/shale_p073_72.JPG) down there.Â  Very cool stuff, makes me kind of happy that I live up here, actually.
