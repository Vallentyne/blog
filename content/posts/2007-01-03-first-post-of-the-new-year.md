Happy New Year's folks.

It's back to work for me, so that usually means a bit more content up here to while away a minute or two during the day.  Things have been nice and quiet since New Year's, we are reveling in a nice lull in the usual craziness.  Nikki and I had a great time on New Year's Eve at [Calabogie Peaks.](http://www.calabogie.com)  We had lots of laughs with the New Year's crew up there, I have pictures to prove it which we will see soon on Flickr.  I highly recommend the place to anyone, it's a top-notch place to stay.

Then on New Year's Day Nikki and I and Jordy finally got to spend some time with a present Jordy got for Christmas:  [Dance Dance Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution).  This is at first glance the most childish game possible; it's about dancing for pete's sake.  But I'm not ashamed to say that Nikki and I sent Jordy to go get ready for bed and went head to head on this thing, and my scientific conclusion is this:  this is not a game about dancing, it's no different that any other button masher.  Nikki and I went toe to toe on this thing to see who was the best.  It wasn't as lopsided a match as it seemed at first; after all Nikki was a dance instructor for years, and I'm rhythmically inept.  But, things turned around dramatically once I realized that it wasn't a game about dancing, and started playing it as such.  I started whupping her butt big time and she couldn't understand why since I wasn't really dancing at all, but rather I decided that the "pogo style" of DDR was the key to success.  It's hard to explain, you sort of have to see it to understand.  Anyway, the end result is I beat her handily, but the unexpected problem the next day was that we were both crippled by calf and leg pain.  I mean seriously.  It's really hard to walk.  Anyway, so that's how a video game caused Nikki and I to unexpectedly become so competitive that we danced through the pain...
