A very dedicated or possibly bored person has compiled a list of words that didn't exist until they were spoken on The Simpsons.  An exhaustive list that is a really funny read.  Some of the best that I find myself using all of the time: craptacular, S-M-R-T, speed holes, and privately, drunkening.

Just reading this list makes me realize how good that show is.  

Shamlessly stolen from [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/), the [Simpsons list on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made-up_words_in_The_Simpsons)

*** Update - Why the heck didn't anybody tell me I can't spell "Simpsons"?
