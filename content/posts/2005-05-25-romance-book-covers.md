Oh crap, this guys [satire of Romance Book covers](http://www.worldoflongmire.com/features/romance_novels/index.htm) is absolutely, incredibly funny.

Some selections of titles:
-Lord of the Hissy Fit
-The Sherriff of Gay County
-For the Love of Scotty McMullett

Be sure to check out the Reader submissions and the "naughty" covers links at the bottom of the page.  They are all excellent.
