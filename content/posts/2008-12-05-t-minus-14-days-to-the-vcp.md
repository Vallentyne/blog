If you haven't already called, or emailed, or Facebooked your attendance to the [VCP](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/9th-annual-christmas-party/) then I encourage you to do so now. Â This date is the milestone day in Nikki's project file when we must start a tally of sugarplums, hall-decking boughs of holly, and a general inventory of the available stock of holiday wishes. Â Having a good time is serious fricking business, people. Â To that end, please please don't make us adjust our project milestones, it really screws up the [Gantt chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart), and messed up Gantt charts are enough to really put a kink in Nikki's party planning groove.

It's ironic that I post this on the blog, which as we all know has a readership that could be contained inside a Toyota Prius with their dogs included, but hey it makes me feel good. Â Besides this week has seen rather spotty publishing updates, so I really needed some filler to make it up. Â So, here we are. Â Pointless party plug.

Still, what you have read you cannot unread, and now you can't complain even more about the lack of original content posted here. Â So there.
