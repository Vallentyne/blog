My wife is obviously delirious.  The rink is NOT Olympic sized.  It does conform to NHL regulations, see [here](http://nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule02.html).  Well, ok so it doesn't quite live up to those standards yet, but it will someday.  Oh yes, Nairn Gardens will one day draw crowds of beer swilling nutjobs just to see the elegant ballet played in the great out of doors.  Come to think of it, Nairn St. already draws lots of beer swilling nutjobs, but at least this time they will be outside.

Stay tuned for the Nairn Gardens playoff series.

Out.
