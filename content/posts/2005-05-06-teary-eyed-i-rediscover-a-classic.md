In case this doesn't make any sense to you, I will warn you it's a little weird.

As a kid I saw this show and loved it.  It was funny and weird and wasn't a cartoon, which is pretty odd for the shows I watched at the time (probably the A-Team was high on the list at the time).  [The Hilarious House of Frightenstein](http://frightenstein.com/main.html) now seems like a real rule-breaker for television.  How they ever made it, I will never know.  The tribute web site is incredible, tons of sound clips and lots of pictures, I haven't even started to go through them.  Anyway, check it out, and be sure to check out the link to "[The Show](http://www.frightenstein.com/show.html)" it has some neat facts on how they filmed it and some stories on the crew working with Vincent Price and how cool he was.

Anyway, it's an awesome flashback to a great show, I wonder if it will ever come out on DVD?  Probably not because they would never be able to license the music they used today, it was awesome rock and roll.
