Hey everyone,
A lot has happened since my last post.  Things are crazy busy but starting to finally die down some I think.  It's hard to believe that Cael is only 3 months, given the sheer amount of things going on all the time.  At his 3 month appointment the brute weighed in at 18lbs 3 oz, give or take.  That just about doubles his birth weight people.
