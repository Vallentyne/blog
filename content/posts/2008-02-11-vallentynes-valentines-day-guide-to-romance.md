In early February this site sees search traffic skyrocket due to lousy spellers looking for **loev**.Â  Well, ok so that doesn't really happen at all, but sometimes you have to fudge the truth to make things topical ok?

In any case, I have [previously mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/02/12/in-honour-of-valentines-day/) some sure-fire tips to woo and wow your wonderful woman.Â  Wow, see what I did there?.Â Â I highly recommend that you readÂ that post and think to yourself, now what can I (you) do to make the woman of my (your) dreams (not [Bea Arthur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Arthur) or [Rue McClanahan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_McClanahan), your wife/girlfriend) remember why it is that she keeps my(your) sorry arse around?Â  Yes, yes it's a fabricated holiday made up by the greeting card company, we all know that.Â  You don't need an excuse to be romantic, you could do it any old day of the year, sure.Â  You do, don't you?Â  If you can't recall exactly when the last time you were spontaneously romantic, perhaps you **should** let Hallmark and Nestle steer you gently into spending a few dollars on a freaking card and some chocolates.Â  It's a good idea to show up on occasions like these, they are the minimum, the lowest romantic common denominator let's say.Â  The damesÂ dig it.Â  For other great ideas on what the skirts love to see, check out [last year's advice](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/02/12/in-honour-of-valentines-day/).

That's what it's all about, fellas.Â  Show off your romantic prowess, it pays.Â  You might even get some, if you remembered to brush your teeth and back hair.Â 

**Disclaimer**

I know nothing about women.Â  Nikki is clearly out of my league, but fortunately for me she hit her head pretty hard in her early 20's and hasn't been quite right since.Â  So, she thinks I'm Brad Pitt.Â  A terrible tragedy for her, but I'm certainly not going to get her head fixed, I'm not stupid.Â  As a result, take any romantic advice from me at your own peril.
