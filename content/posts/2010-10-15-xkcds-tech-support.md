Oh, man does this comic from xkcd ever nail the frustration of calling a help desk PERFECTLY.Â  As a geek there are few things more teeth-gnashingly horrible than having to call a help desk for a problem you know you can't fix yourself, but you also know IN YOUR BONES that the poor guy that first picks up the phone definitely can't fix it either.Â  A code word would be really really awesome, and of course immediately unusable because the knowledge of such a word would leak immediately and render it powerless because everyone would just start babbling "shibboleet" as soon as the phone got answered, even if they know nothing.

Still, it's fun to dream about.
