Sea Lions are showing the US Army Corps of Engineers who's boss by [outsmarting them again and again](http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/04/03/smart.sea.lion.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories).  A good story on CNN, showing how sea lions, and one in particular, are exasperating the Army boys by finding new ways to eat more than their fair share of salmon.  Evolution will surely soon grant these little guys thumbs, if only so that they can use them to go "Nyah nyah" to silly bipeds.

I enjoy this sort of thing because it's good to remember to be humbled by nature.  You may remember the idiots who were trying the [capture otters and release them](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/11/alright_who_are.html), only to have them find their way home again?

Anyway, there you go.
