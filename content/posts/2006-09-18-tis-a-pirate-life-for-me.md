If you like [Talk Like a Pirate day](http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html), which is tomorrow, then why not live like a pirate all of the time?

I can't believe how so completely totally awesomely this pirate playhouse rocks.

For a mere $19000USD you can own this sucker, but you will have to do some "site preparation" yourself, like pouring a concrete slab with footers to support the weight of this thing.  I can't imagine a cooler thing to have as a kid though.  If you are the child of an independently wealthy and successful pirate who now lives in the burbs, that is.
The funniest part of the whole thing is you can buy this thing [from Costco](http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11165003&whse=BC&Ne=4000000&N=4000486&Mo=47&No=0&Nr=P_CatalogName:BC&cat=1482&Ns=P_Price%7C1%7C%7CP_SignDesc1&Sp=C&topnav=), which lists all of the stuff you have to do to receive the thing (concrete slab poured, have a crane or forklift handy when the 18 wheeler rolls in, etc), but then goes on to say that you can return it at any of their 400 locations.  Yeah, right.

I found the [manufacturers website](http://danielswoodland.com/index.html) and it's just incredible the range of tree houses they offer.   I wish I was a kid with lots of money....
