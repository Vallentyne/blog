In my travels I stumbled across two things that are of interest:  First off, a new (new to me) blog called [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com).  It's very very good stuff.

Secondly, I can prove it's interesting because I'm immediately regurgitating one of the first links I saw:  [Incredible and disturbing surreal "photography"](http://www.parkeharrison.com/main.html)  There are some incredible pictures up here.  Did I mention they were incredible?

Also surreal, also from Metafilter, is [the surreal gourmet](http://www.surrealgourmet.com).  Here's [a recipe to poach salmon](http://www.surrealgourmet.com/html/recipes/salmon.html) in your dishwasher.  Not my cup of tea, but I wonder how the salmon tastes with the rinse agent that we use to make sure there are no spots on the glasses?  I'm thinking you probably shouldn't eat that stuff, eh?  Oh well, it's still neat.
