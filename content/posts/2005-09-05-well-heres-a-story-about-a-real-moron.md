I'm firmly in the "bad owners make bad dogs" camp when it comes to any dog attack, but you only ever hear about pit bull attacks anyway.  [Guys like this](http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0534,shaftel,67093,5.html) are the main reason.  It's a story about an idiot in New York breeding pit bulls for viciousness, specifically.  

Man, what a dick.
