I don't know why the word underpants seems funny to me at the moment, but there you go.

To follow up on my post about our [Fancy Pants weekend](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/01/23/fancy-pants-weekend/), I could think of no lamer segue than the barest of common threads: pants.  So without further ado, here are two underpant-related products that actually stretch the bounds of good taste, if you can believe that such a thing is possible on this blog.

First off (from our [Good Friend Wilson](http://www.robertwilsonphoto.com)) we have[ a "medical" product](http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007030500,00.html) targeted at people with IBS or other such intestinal troubles.  It's basically airtight underpants with a charcoal filter built in, that claims to "ensure the elimination of nasty odours".  Now here's a thought.  I'm certainly no expert on biochemistry and such, and while I also am a big fan of clean air for all, I'm wondering the long term side effects of wearing these things when they trap all of your worst stuff in essentially an airtight pocket around your genitals.  I'm thinking of stuff like crotch-rot, pubic hair bleaching, even sterility.  I have absolutely no science to back any of this up, but come on is it that hard to imagine? There's a reason we get rid of that stuff, you know, and normally it's gone with the wind.  Just something to be cautious about, but then again if you are actually considering buying these things, then maybe you are willing to take your chances?

Then we have an even more distasteful product.  I will spare you the product image, it's a "safe" that you hide money in.  Except the safe looks like a pair of [skidmarked underwear](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/24/skid_mark_underwear_.html).  I guess you leave these things lying around on the floor or something and if someone breaks into your home, they won't likely want to touch them.  I think they have that part well thought out, at least.  My only problem with it is the thought of putting my money in there to begin with.  That's a little nasty.  I hate to imagine the crime levels in your neighbourhood if you have to consider this product as a way of keeping your money safe.  Anyway, there you go, more pants related news for you.
