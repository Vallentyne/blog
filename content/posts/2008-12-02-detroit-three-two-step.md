Tomorrow the three Detroit car companies [get to come back to Congress](http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081202.wibautos02/BNStory/Business/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081202.wibautos02) and try to ask even more politely for $25 billion in order to keep the lights on in some way or another. Â While I had lots of fun [the last time they came to town](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/11/25/my-wallets-too-small-for-my-50s-and-my-diamond-shoes-are-too-tight/), they really need to get this right. Â The impact of even one of these companies failing outright is massive and (for me at least) unmeasurable. Â Whole towns will suffer if the local plant closes, as at least some surely will. Â These guys have to show some real willingness to change everything about their companies, or they will be laughed out of the room again.Â 

I think that the right approach by the car companies will tip things even farther towards wise energy use, renewable technologies and a better environment. Â Cars and transportation are big energy consumers of course, but I think that the sheer visibility of cars and trucks on the road will help to change the day to day thinking of people for the better. Â 

I think that later we will look back on events like this with a different perspective. Â Like maybe we will look back in awe and say wow, those guys were in a tight spot and they really made the right decision and look at how much better things are now. Â 

Or you never know, they might take the frigging private jets again. Â Actually it seems that at least the Ford CEO learned his lesson, and will be driving to Washington this time. Â Probably in a huge honking special SUV that runs on baby seals and styrofoam.
