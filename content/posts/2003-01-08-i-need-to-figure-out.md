I need to figure out how to get links working before this is ready for prime time.  I mean links in the template itself.  Maybe I can just steal some code somewhere to do that.  Must brush up on html sometime.  Or actually learn anything about it, to be accurate.

I really should just be working, but this is pretty fun.
