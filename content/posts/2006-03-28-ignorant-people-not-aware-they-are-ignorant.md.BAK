If there ever was a contender for an article to completely describe this blog, [this is it.](http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=406)

It comes from the increasingly interesting [Damn Interesting](http://www.damninteresting.com) and it describes how people who are, um, less gifted, let's say always over estimate their own abilities.  The more incompetent they are, the less able they are to realize it, sort of a "vicious stupid circle".  It's a good read.  The only way to get people to get better at estimating their own abilities is to make them more able, apparently.

So, what do you think?  Mundane Ramblings: Home of the Clinically Ignorant

Catchy eh?
