Many thanks to good neighbour Jim for organizing what appears will be the last Hockey Night in Kanata.  We had about 7 or 8 skaters show up to slog it out on a rink that was deteriorating by the minute.  It looked more like a minefield than a rink by the time we were done, but it was a good time.  It was incredible that we didn't have any sprained ankles from the huge holes in the rink.
Then the party continued on inside for quite a while, from the living room to the hot tub.  Needless to say there were a lot of interesting happenings in the hot tub, but it was more like an episode of Jerry Springer than anything X-rated.  Good times, eh?

It will take a weather miracle for us to be skating again this year I would imagine, but even so it was a good run.

Jim and I have already started planning for next year's rink....  Maybe not bigger, but certainly better.
