Oh, that's not funny.  I just wrote a huge update about Nikki having Norwalk and Quinn and I spending the day together while Jordy was at school and this darn website crashed, losing all my stuff.  Sigh.  Oh well.  Anyway, the main gist of it all is as follows:  Nikki is ok, sleeping a lot and hopefully will be on solid food again soon, Quinn surprised the heck out of me today by pulling himself up on the lazyboy in the living room, kneeling in front of it.  I also plugged [www.popcap.com](http://www.popcap.com) because it's free and so fun for all ages.  I finished by saying that Steve Earle's Jerusalem and Bruce Springsteen's The Rising are freakin' excellent albums that just happen to be inspired by 9/11.

Quick lyric snippets are as follows:

Steve Earle's "John Walker's Blues"
**I'm just an American boy raised on MTV 
And I've seen all those kids in the soda pop ads 
But none of 'em looked like me 
So I started lookin' around for a light out of the dim 
And the first thing I heard that made sense was the word 
Of Mohammed, peace be upon him **

Bruce's "The Rising"
**Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
Wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here**

Just really good, and go now and buy the CD.  

That's all for now.
