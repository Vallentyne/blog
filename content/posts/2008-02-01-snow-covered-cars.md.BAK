Just in time for a huge winter storm; here's another rant for you; morons who drive snow covered vehicles. I'm sure there is a little-used bylaw that covers this somewhere, but they really should enforce it a little more. I just love driving behind these guys, the snow blowing off their car and obscuring the view of everyone behind them.

Or even better are the drivers that have several week's worth of accumulation on there, iced and packed into a deadly snow frisbee. These things release spontaneously at high speed on the highway and smash down onto the hood and windshields of cars behind them. It's enough to cause an accident, and I'm sure it has at some point. Most often it's the people with minivans and trucks and SUVs that can't seem to be bothered to brush the snow off the roof of their vehicle. I can say that because I own a minivan and you will never see me leave snow on there.

So remember tonight when 30 cm ofÂ snow is falling, clean off your cars people.Â  It has nothing to do with you, but the guy behind you.

I guess I needÂ  a cup of coffee or a hug, or both this morning.Â  I will ask the guy in the cubicle next to me if he minds.
