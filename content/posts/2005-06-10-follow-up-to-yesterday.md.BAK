Here's a quick follow up to [yesterday's article](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/06/a_flood_of_news.html) about the creationism guys at the zoo.  Not to be out-done, the evolutionists (I may have just made that word up) have started a [special web site](http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/) to foster the growth of this scientific theory of theirs.

In the interests of remaining un-smoten I will leave this post entirely sarcasm-free.

I'm actually capable of that.  See?
