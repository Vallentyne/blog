Here's a [good article](http://newyorkmetro.com/news/politics/22322/index.html) on one of my favourite shows; The Colbert Report.Â  It's a good look at the man himself and some of the history behind the show.Â  While I wouldn't count myself as part of the "Colbert Nation", I do love the show.Â  It's deadly funny and his schtick hasn't worn thin like I sort of thought it would at the beginning.Â  That's a credit to the writers of the show, and also to his talents as a performer.Â  Ultimately the whole show hangs on his performance every night, there's nobody to back him up.Â  That's more than a bit of pressure....Â  What kills me is his unflinching portrayal of a character with limitless ego.Â  This guy is actually cockier than I am.
If you haven't seen it, be sure to check it out.Â  That and The Daily Show are the only two shows I watch.Â  Literally.Â  Maybe I should make an effort to watch something else....Â  maybe it's skewing my perceptions a bit.Â  Ya think?
