I sat on this for a whole week, because I'm a lazy lazy man.  Our good friend Ali recently (re-)started her own editing business and I didn't even mention it here.  Sorry Ali, many apologies.

An editing business is a great idea, but it must be hrd to maek munny at b3cause nobuddy maeks misteaks anymore, what with the spelcheckers and such.  Good luck anyway Ali on your numerous new endeavours.

Ali joins her sister in completely owning the Internet.  Wanda has had her own business going for a while now, and it fits nicely with Ali because between Wanda setting up your IT and office, and Ali making you sound much smarterer than you really are, starting a business with these two by your side is a snarp.
