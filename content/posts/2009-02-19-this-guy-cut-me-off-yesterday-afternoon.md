On the way home yesterday this guy carefully looked at me, made eye contact, and then thoughtfully swerved right into my lane without even signaling, or waiting for an opening, requiring me to actually avoid his car.Â  He's a jerk, so I thought I would get his plate and then do absolutely nothing about it (that's what I do).Â  Fortunately that's what cameraphones are made for, so I got this shot, but the timing was poor with my wipers so I can't really even make it out now through the raindrops.Â  Sigh.

There's your impotent, trembling, pathetic geek rage for today.Â  I bet this guy is scared now.
