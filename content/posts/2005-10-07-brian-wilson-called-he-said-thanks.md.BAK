Very very cool fundraising idea from that Beach Boy.  He posted a message on his web site, saying that if you donated $100 or more to Katrina relief efforts he would personally match the donation and call you himself to thank you.  Pretty frigging cool for Beach Boy fans.  He has raised over $200k so far, very cool.
