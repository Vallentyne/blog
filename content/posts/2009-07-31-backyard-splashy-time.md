Lloyd, Harvey and the boys had some much deserved backyard time yesterday in the wonderful sun.Â  I was sitting on my arse watching them after I came home from work and snapped a few pics with my phone.Â  I think you can see how much fun they were having, each in their own pools.Â  The boy's pool is inflatable and so it's off limits for Bitey McPunctureton seen here digging his way to the bottom of his pool of water.Â  Keep digging, Bitey...

Then I took a shot of the inevitable results of splashing, you can see Lloyd here in mid-rotation, which makes his ears look stupid.

Of course after this I had to empty the pool to begin [the emptying](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/07/16/lloyds-love-of-water/) as supper was almost ready...
