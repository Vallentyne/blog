Hey y'all. I thought I'd give posting another quick go. Nice to hear the Mighty is giving new meaning to the word "castaway" today. And speaking of things nautical (groan), did you know that the California gubernatorial race has received a slight bit of credibility with the announced candidacy of our favourite sailor, Captain Morgan? That's right! This 368-year-old go-getter is running on a party-hard party platform, and though his website could use a little work, I think that if you link to his bio from [here ](http://www.californians4captainmorgan.org/main.html?)  you'll be pleased you did. The best part is the "Fast Facts" about the Captain, especially "Favourite Letter: ARRRRRR".
