A family update for you, Jordy is now finally taking the babysitting course, which is a good thing for everybody (including Nikki and I of course).  Her schedule is already filling up as people aren't willing to wait for her to finish the darn thing before asking her to watch their kids.  That probably says something about the kind of responsible young lady she is becoming.  It's a good thing.

Quinn is quickly learning lots of good stuff at school, he is really starting to get the hang of printing for one.  He quickly and neatly printed "Dad" without any assistance yesterday which surprised both Nik and I since we haven't really tested him much yet.  It's fun to watch.

Cael is also starting to tone things down, our recent strategies seem to be working to curb the worst of the storm.  So we will correspondingly take the Caelstrom stormwatch rating down from a Category 5 "Wizard of OZ level house-flattener" to a Category 3 "Brisk wet wind that just screws up your hairdo for the whole day".  Of course it may just be that we are becoming accustomed to living inside the hurriCael...

This morning I happened to overhear Quinn and Cael having an early morning chat before anyone else was up:

**Quinn**: No, you're not a baby.  You're a big boy.  But you're Mommy's baby.

**Cael**: No I'm not (chuckling)

**Quinn**: Yes you are, and I'm Mommy's baby too.

**Cael**: Why?

**Quinn**: We're Mommy's babies because she loves us.</blockquote>

There's a warm fuzzy for you this morning.
