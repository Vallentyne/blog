Ok, so it has nothing to do with the holiday season, but how else can I have a reason to post a song I really meant to have up here weeks ago?

[Re: Your Brains](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songdetails/Re%20Your%20Brains) is a hilarious nerd folk song by [Jonathon Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/), an ode to the workplace zombie with note-perfect sarcasm:


<blockquote>All we want to do is eat your brains
Weâ€™re not unreasonable, I mean, no oneâ€™s gonna eat your eyes
All we want to do is eat your brains
Weâ€™re at an impasse here, maybe we should compromise:
If you open up the doors
Weâ€™ll all come inside and eat your brains</blockquote>


Gotta love that.  The video is a mash up of silly zombie movies so expect to be nauseated by kitschy violence and gore, but otherwise, enjoy.  The actual zombie part of the song is how it takes up residence inside your head and won't leave.  I was shoveling snow off the laneway, muttering it.  Passersby ran away.
