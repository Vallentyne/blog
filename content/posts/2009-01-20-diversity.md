Today was the first of monthly visits Iâ€™m scheduled to make to Quinnâ€™s classroom to help out in the mornings.  I agreed to once a month, thinking I would do this for both the boys and be at the school once every two weeks.  Turns out that the kindergarten class doesnâ€™t need me, but the Grade 1â€™s were happy to have the help.  After today I may be offering up more of my mornings.

Everyone knows every child is different and it is impossibly hard to compare any one child to another.  Personalities, learning styles, comprehension, focus, and the general willingness to please (or not) are just a few of the characteristics that you find crammed into one classroom.  All of these characteristics can make a classroom very crowded despite the number of children there are inside.  Quinn has 16 kids in his classroom.  This was amazing news for us considering Jordynn has had up to 31 kids in her classrooms over the years.  I think it is wonderful to have a smaller class.  You would think it would give a teacher an abundance of time for individual attention.  This is not necessarily the case.

I spent the morning with a beautiful little boy who I was told has yet to be â€œassessedâ€.  This particular little man needs one on one attention to be able to stay focused on a task and unfortunately he does not have an EA.  He and I had a very successful morning together and the teachers were happy with his progress.  This progress only happens for this little trooper when he has someone working with him.  Unfortunately all the other days, when there isnâ€™t the one on one, he does not find the same success or achievement.  This broke my heart.  This is also hard on the teacher who is unable to give what she obviously wants to give to this student as it would take from all the others.  16 is a rather big number now in my eyes.

Then I saw children who just seemed to not have any respect for the teachers repeated requests to be quiet, pay attention, work on the assignment, or put up their hand.  I was however told that today they were a little excitable (likely due to my presence), but I know some of these kids from Quinn and his teachers in past years, and am fully aware of what the teacher has to face every day with some of them, mainly their lack of respect.

Of course among these children are some that have been desensitized to the regular distractions and disruptions of others and coast through their day, following rules, and looking forward to recess to burn off the boredom/frustration.

I guess in a way it is like any job where you are subjected to all different types of personalities, opinions and behaviours.  Call it a wakeup call for me though to see firsthand the skills our children learn at such a young age.  Given the restrictions put upon our teachers for maintaining order, it appears to me that our kids are forced to grow up a little sooner with the life lesson of tolerance, or sadly, the disservice of just being tolerated.

Let me finish by saying this; I left that classroom this morning with a warm fuzzy in my heart having given to a kid who deserves more that what is presently available to him.  We had success.  We did the assignmentâ€¦albeit not easilyâ€¦and not without steady redirection to the task at hand, but the smile on that little boys face made my cup runeth over.  He beamed, puffed out his chest and took his work to the teacher for his well deserved praise.  We even did the extra bonus work damn itâ€¦and by God he felt good about it.  Our shared high-five at the end of that made my day/week/month.   The sad part is the ache in my heart for I know that tomorrow may not be as good a day for my new little friend.

There is an ache in my heart for those who will potentially never learn respect for others, and will unfortunately grow up being tolerated, never knowing that isnâ€™t a good quality in life.

There is an ache in my heart for those who are held back from their full potential as a result of having to tolerate others.

Hats off to teachers.  Whitney, I think of you often and admire your perseverance, your patience, your tolerance.  Today reminded me of my respect for teachers.  Especially the good ones.  We need them.

So the next time the form comes home in your childâ€™s back pack to see if you are willing to offer up some of your time to volunteer in the classroomâ€¦and you could actually make some timeâ€¦.donâ€™t recycle it right away thinking you are already too busy with life and its demands.  Think of my little buddy who may only have one morning a month with a mom who didnâ€™t realize how badly she was needed in the first place.
