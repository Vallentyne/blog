Ok, so I think I know a little bit about technology.  I'm serious here, I am in the computer business and run this little blog, it pays the bills and all.  Well, not the blog, but the computer business.  The blog is pure vanity, as you all have come to realize.  All of you, my reader.

Anyway, back to my topic.  Technology and I are more than just passing acquaintances, in my mind.  So, knowing that, why am I constantly confounded by a _relatively_ low-tech invention: the photocopier.  I'm talking about complete barrier to understanding sort of ignorance here people, not just the occasional "Whoops I forgot to cross-collate before stapling".  I just don't get it.  It's embarassing.

I walk into the photocopier room with a sense of dread everytime.  I just know I won't do it right.  If I have like one sheet I want a copy of that's ok, I can do that.  Lift the lid and press Start.  It's when I have a multipage document that I need a few copies of, that's when things get downright terrifying.  Will this thing come out sorted or not?  I better not ask for staples just in case it's not.  I won't even attempt to photocopy a duplexed original and expect anything good to happen.  I leave lots of time to fight with the photocopier before a meeting just in case I need it.

Anybody with me here?
