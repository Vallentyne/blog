Â I have [mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/08/24/dont-bogart-the-meatballs/) [pot](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/10/13/10-foot-tall-dope-plants-stump-troops/) [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/04/03/as-if-you-didnt-see-this-coming/) on the blog before.Â  Don't get me wrong, I never use the stuff.Â  I do think that the energy and money spent on trying to regulate and persecute it's use is wasteful and needless in the extreme.Â  Personally I fail to see the difference between the use of recreational alcohol and pot, but that's just me.Â  In my mind the government is throwing a very lucrative taxable revenue away by trying to keep people away from this stuff.Â  However, lots of folks apparently think differently because pot is still not legal, so there you go.

Anyway, here's a couple of pot-related stories from Canoe.ca.

First is a bit about a prison in Tokyo that has a [rampant weed problem](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/29/4455551-ap.html) in it's exercise yard.Â  Literally, marijuana plants keep growing inside the prison yard and they can't seem to get rid of them.

Now that's funny.Â  The prisoners reported the plants riiight away, fer sure.

Next is the tale of an intrepid police officer who surely has succeeded in [cracking one of the larger drug rings](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/24/4444243-ap.html ) in the U.S.Â  Apparently the officer was driving by the home of a 71 year old woman, and spotted a 4 foot marijuana plant growing in her backyard.Â  The woman tried to do the bewildered old lady defence and said the plant was to keep animals away from her garden.Â  This might have worked but was probably ruined after the officer then discovered a bong, five more plants, seeds, etc inside her house.Â  Got to give her points for imagination, though.Â  Thank goodness he took that dangerous 71 year old lady off the streets, though.Â  I will sleep a lot safer knowing she isn't baking brownies for her bridge club anymore.
