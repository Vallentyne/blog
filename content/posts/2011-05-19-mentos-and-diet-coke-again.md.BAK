The Internet has pretty much covered this fun phenomenon to death, but I happened across this video today via Neatorama, and I must say that it's worth a watch.Â  I didn't realize that you could do this with Mentos and Diet Coke, but I see now that this reaction is a lot more potentially dangerous than I first realized.

Enjoy

For bonus points, this is particularly diabolical.
