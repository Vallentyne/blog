So, is it just me, or is this sunshine not putting a smile on your face that even a wire brush couldn't remove?

The kids have exactly 8 (for Jordy) & 9 (for the lads) days of school left.  The end just can't come soon enough.  All these beautiful days are here, and they are stuck in school.  Makes me crazy.  It better not rain when I can actually take them to parks, picnics and the beach.

I'm going to take this opportunity to gush a little. I have to say that over the years of the newborn phase, the toddler phase, the POTTY TRAINING PHASE...ahhh! - I think we went through all of that just to get here.  Holy Cow!  These kids are fun.  I'm enjoying the absolute stuffing out of them.  Being a stay-at-home mom has never been so fun.  I can go anywhere at a moments notice, and everybody's game.  All we have to do is pee before we head out the door and we're all golden!  We have two furry children on top of the three human children and even still I can say, "life rocks!"  Its a rare day when we aren't all in a great mood.  No meltdowns, no fits.  Ahhhh.....perfect.  I just CAN NOT WAIT to go to Wonderland with these kids again.  They just get more and more fun.

IS SUMMER HERE YET ALREADY!?!?!?!?!?!?!

So, I have 3 great kids, two awesome dogs, and a husband that is better than the greatest wish I could muster up.  If I could hug a freakin' rainbow - I would.

Soak up some sun today people....it's beautiful out there.
