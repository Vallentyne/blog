It's amazing to see the competitive streak Quinn has recently developed. Â I never had it, and I really don't think Nikki has it, so we are at a loss to explain where it comes from. Â Just the other night a fun game of Crazy Eights was soured at the very end when Quinn realized he hadn't won a single game (Cael surprised us all by winning 3 out of 4). Â He put on a very pronounced pout, and was sullen when we called him on it. Â This kid just has to win, maybe not all of the time, but boy is he keeping track.

The fact that this year is his first year to be all day at school probably has a lot to do with it. Â It's surprising how little we really know about what is going on there all day (I know we have been doing this for years now with Jordy, it's just new for the boys again). Â It makes me wonder what kind of games they play at recess. Â Recently he has been taking a stronger interest in sports, mostly hockey. Â We have skating lessons coming up for both boys in January and Quinn is stoked about it. Â Cael not so much. Â Road hockey has become a new favourite and we have spent lots of time recently messing around on the street. Â There's not a hint of any issues with competition then, we never even keep score. Â If you try playing a board game or card game though, look out.

I can't figure it out, it's really weird. Â I don't necessarily want to squash it altogether, but it's hard to strike a balance between pushover and raging animal when winning is at stake.
