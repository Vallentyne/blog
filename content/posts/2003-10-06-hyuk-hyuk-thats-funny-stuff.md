Hyuk hyuk.  That's funny stuff. 




Actually the weekend turned out ok, somehow.  Let me reiterate how much I dislike the whole bed and breakfast industry **before** I begin.




The weekend began calmly enough.  

We get all of the kids taken care of as quickly as possible on Friday and begin our trek to Quebec City.  I quickly give in to Nikki's guesses and she is more or less fully aware of what we are up to, finally.  It's about 9pm and we are about halfway through Montreal when my cell phone rings.  It's the bed and breakfast I booked us into, huh.  The "lady" on the phone is let's say, less than agreeable, and informs us that due to our late arrival our reservation is cancelled.  Now, when I made the reservation it couldn't have been plainer that I was coming from Ottawa, and I said as much.  The "lady" said that she never would have made the reservation if we were going to be later than 7pm.  Hm, so they're not exactly the best at public relations, let's say.  Before hanging up on me I ask if she will still honour my reservation for tomorrow night, she's not exactly forthcoming with a yes, but I am left with that impression.




We end up staying in [a beautiful hotel](http://www.loewshotels.com/hotels/quebec/default.asp) right near the old city, and getting spoiled terribly.  Not is all lost.




Needless to say after that little episode Nikki and I decide that we probably don't feel like giving these people any money at all, so we cancel our reservation for Saturday night in the morning and head to Montreal, soured on the Quebec City bed and breakfast industry.  




Now, I wouldn't publicly slander these folks, that can get you into trouble you know.  Nope, I won't tell you that [www.manoirmoncalme.com](http://www.manoirmoncalme.com) is their website.  And I won't tell you that despite the "lady's" insistence there is no mention of check in times on their website.  I could get into some trouble, probably, for even suggesting that nobody should ever go there.  I'm bigger than that.  I won't also mention the whole condescending attitude and the feeling that they are doing us a favour somehow by letting us stay there.  Nope.  Not me.




I will say that they really suck though.
