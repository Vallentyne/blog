Took a whole crew to see "Up" on Saturday.

Do yourself a favour and take everyone you know to see this, we should reward complex, emotional storytelling in lieu of cheap crap.Â  Best of all, you can take the whole family.Â  The story was touching, funny, exhilarating, it has everything.

We all enjoyed it tremendously, and it seems that [lots of other people did too](http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/boxoffice/).
