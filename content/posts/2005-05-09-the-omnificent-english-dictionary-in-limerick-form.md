Holy cow, [this is really neat and useless](http://www.oedilf.com/db/Lim.php).  

It's an attempt to create a "dictionary" of the English language using limericks to describe each word.  Some of them are excellent and funny.
There are some mean limerick writers out there, I must say.  It's not my heart's desire to create one to have it published there, but hey if it turns your crank, go for it.

They are currently looking for limerick submissions on the words in the aa- to ba- range.  

Looks like they could be at this a while....
