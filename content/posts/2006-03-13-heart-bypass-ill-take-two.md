A small note, I was feeling creative yesterday and I thought I would try my hand in the kitchen.  Being a man's geek, I hit [Allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com) and found a chili recipe to make.  I must say while it had zero kid appeal, Nikki and I liked it.  Or rather I really liked it, Nikki maybe was being kind.  In any case, here's the link:  [Chili Rick's](http://soup.allrecipes.com/az/ChiliRicks.asp) 

I made it just like the recipe calls for, except I skipped the kidney beans altogether and added some canned mushrooms instead.  Very good, and pretty easy once you cook all of the meat.

Anyway, there you go.  I realize now that this orgy of meat may be at least subconsciously in retaliation to the [Vegan Lunch Box](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/03/kiddies_lunch_b.html) post a few days ago.  I don't have anything against vegans, by the way, whatever floats your boat.  I just like periodically tasting dishes that have been prepared carefully and seasoned delicately with 6 pounds of meat.  I'm not kidding, look at the recipe.
