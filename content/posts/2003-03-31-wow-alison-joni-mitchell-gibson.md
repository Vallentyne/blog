Wow. Alison "Joni Mitchell" Gibson. That is too good! And now that Vallentyne has got me thinking about The Sound of Music, that's the only way I can read it now, too! Way to go, Court.

I think you gotta relax on the whole stealin' thing, Court. I think the musicians and record execs are still feeding their families just fine. Look at it in a Robinhood vs. Sherrif of Nottingham kinda way. I wouldn't worry about the kids either. By the time they're old enough to care, this whole thing will be resolved and the record labels will be selling individual songs to you online for the low, low price of $8.95/song with a buy twelve get a dollar off you're next purchase incentive plan. Then everything will be right in the universe again...or, at least back to the way things were with the Labels bending us over the table again.
