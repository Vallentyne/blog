Oh lord, I must be sleep deprived, but this struck me as so funny, I had to resort to some very fancy peristaltic acrobatics to make sure I didn't spray paint my monitor with coffee.

Greenpeace is having a Name a Whale contest.Â  They asked for names from the public.Â  They got 11 000 names, which were whittled down to 30, noble names from various languages, but one of which was **Mr. Splashy Pants**.Â  Guess which one currently has an overwhelming lead?

Results [here](http://vote.greenpeace.org/11/12/results), vote for Mr. Splashy Pants [here](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/great-whale-trail/gwt-vote).

Â Saw this on [Boing Boing](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/191118760/mr-splashy-pants-in.html).
