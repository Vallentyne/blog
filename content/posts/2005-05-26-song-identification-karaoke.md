So there's a [ridiculous new service](http://www.411song.com/) coming out that will identify a song on the radio for you, here's how it works:

You hear a song on the radio, haul out your cell phone and dial 411-SONG in a sweaty panic.  Wait for the beep, and hold your cell phone out to the radio and it will text message you back with the information about the song title, artist, etc.  Wow, cool, you think.  Wait, it costs .99 per song for the first 5, and I'm sure it only goes up from there? Great!  Where do I sign up?

But actually people, despite the fact that this service is completely retarded, there's more to the game.  I propose that this service could be used to play Texas Hold'em Karaoke (or that's what I think it could be called).  Here's how I envision it:

You and the other player "bet" by naming songs that you think you could sing into your phone and have accurately identified by the service.  If you win the bet (meaning the other guy calls), you use your cell phone to place the call and belt out the tune.  If the service correctly answers the song, he pays up.

Whaddya think?  Anybody wanna go Idol-a-Idol?

Oh, it's only available in the States.  Oh well.
