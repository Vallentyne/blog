Hi folks.

It's friday again and I am booored.

Did you know that a google for "random ramblings" returns 83000 hits?  Did you also know that searching for your own website and not finding it isn't good for the ego?  Just kidding, it's there, you just have to look harder.  Still, "Random Ramblings" seems a bit pedestrian as a blog name.  How about we have some submissions on a new name?  That sounds like a good idea.  Come on people, let's have 'em.  While we are at it, are there any suggestions for new features or content?  I'm always looking for an excuse to mess with things at home, it helps to get some ideas.

By the way, Kent's tip paid off last night, I managed to tape the TPB episode that we missed while watching the dismal hockey game.

by the way, I am going to be even more protective and jealous of my beautiful wife from now on, she recently got her hair braided and I like it a lot....that's just fair warning for you people.

later.
