I wish I was making this up.  I really do.

I will apologize to Nikki in advance, her Air Guitar allergy (windstrummus moronicus) is well known to our friends, I can only hope it doesn't flare up too badly.

Apparently there is a [sort of competition](http://www.airguitarusa.com/) for these guys, not only for the US, but naturally, inevitably, inexorably culminating in the [World Air Guitar Championships](http://www.omvf.net/2005/ilmakitara.php?lang=en) (The flash on that site made me chuckle).  The best part?  The organizers are obviously not without a sense of humour because the winner of the World Championships gets a sweet electric guitar and amp (real ones), because just maybe together we can stop the madness.

I must say that I enjoyed [the videos](http://www.airguitarusa.com/halloffame.html), which you must watch.

Stolen from [Metafilter](http://www.Metafilter.com), the best source of this crap I have ever found.
