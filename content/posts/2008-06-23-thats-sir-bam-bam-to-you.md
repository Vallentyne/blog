It seems that our most [casual observations](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/06/22/boy-time-sure-flies-when/) may be gaining some authority.Â  Nikki was messing around with a [height predictor on Babycenter.com](http://parentcenter.babycenter.com/child-height-predictor?intcmp=Nav_Global_Tools_heightpredictor), and it seems we may have a problem.Â  This little doodad takes the child's current age, height and weight, the parent's height and give a prediction of just how tall your kid might grow.

Quinn slots in at a "carbon copy of me" 6 feet.Â  Jordy is going to be more or less exactly Nikki's 5'5".Â  Cael on the other hand, seems to be a bit of a problem.Â  It seems that the good folks at Babycenter think Cael will be 6'5" by the time he's 18.Â  Oh, and just in case that wasn't enough, there's a 90% chance that this guess will be within 2.1 inches.Â  EITHER WAY.Â  Imagine for a minute a 6'5"(or 6'7") 18 year old jumping up and down, waiting for his supper, which probably will amount to a half a pig every day or so by then.

I better take up farming or something, or these kids are going to eat me into the poorhouse.
