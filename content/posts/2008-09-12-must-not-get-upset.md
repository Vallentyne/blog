[Wilson](http://robertwilsonphoto.com/) has been goading me all week long with links about the music industry and how stupid it's being. Â He's trying to get me to go off on a rant here, I think he secretly likes it. Â I won't oblige him though, because I have become oblivious to the thrashings of a dying business. Â He would love nothing more than for me to link to th[i](http://torrentfreak.com/slipknot-frontman-says-record-labels-cause-piracy-080910/)s profanity-laced tirade about how most music sucks these days, and no wonder people don't want to pay for it, because it's exactly the sentiment I spout most often. Â No sir, I won't link to it. Â I'm above that. Â 

He also wants me to link to th[i](http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=130766)s article about the sheer stupidity of killing [Muxtape](http://muxtape.com/) (a service I literally joined the day it went down due to RIAA intervention). Â I have long struggled with the ethics of music sharing between friends, new music discovery and the like. Â Muxtape sort of fixed that, really. Â It was a way of making a "mixed tape" for your friends (or anybody) of music you liked or thought went well together. Â You could stream the music from the website, but not download it (or not download it easily). Â I thought it was brilliant, and was looking forward to having a look-see, but lo when I got home after signing up at work, the web site was down due to legal action. Â The article goes on and on about the whole string of dumb moves that seem specifically engineered to drive away paying customers, or to treat us like criminals.

Or, that's what the article probably says, if I read it. Â Which I didn't, of course. Â Because I'm above that now. Â Well, almost.
