In case I don't get to posting tomorrow, being the weekend and all, an early Happy Birthday to Cael!  He will be 2 tomorrow.

He's quite the little boy now, much to his Mother's dismay, getting bigger all the time.  We did away with the high chair in the kitchen for the first time in I can't remember when.  Also, his speech is improving tremendously thanks to his big brother and sister's influence.  He seems to want to be a part of the conversation, and so he makes sure he gets, um, heard.  His temper is also rather well-developed at this point, which makes for some interesting times, mostly between him and Quinn over certain toys.  I swear I never would have dreamed we would be spending that kind of money buying [Thomas trains](http://www.thomasandfriends.com/ca/), let alone 2 of each one to prevent the fighting.

Ah good times.
