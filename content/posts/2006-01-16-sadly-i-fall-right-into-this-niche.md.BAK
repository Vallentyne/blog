An amusing commentary about [the difference between being a programmer and a computer guy](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/01/13/213613.php).  I understand completely where this is coming from, and unlike the author, I fall directly into the problem area of being a "computer guy" instead of a programmer.  

At times I have found myself asked to help with some problem or another with a home PC.  Usually I try to dodge the questions, because as I have said many times, I like to use computers but I absolutely loathe working on them.  I mean I just don't usually enjoy upgrading/troubleshooting home PCs and their problems.  It's generally a huge time-sink that hardly ever seems worth it.  The cases on my home systems are generally never opened up for any reason.  I buy a system from the store, bring it home and plug it in.  Software is my problem, and that's usually something I have lots of patience for (I have to since that's usually 95% of my day job, too).  I regularly tinker with the systems at home, but the hardware remains the same.

Don't get me wrong:  there's a vast difference between working on server-class hardware in the server room at any client and bent over underneath a dusty desk at home with a butter knife for a screwdriver and a mouthful of curses.  When the hardware is designed with maintenance in mind, I usually don't mind maintaining it.

Anyway, just my 2 cents on this matter.
