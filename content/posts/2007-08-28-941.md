In a very strange turn of events, the ocean at a Sydney beach has decided it has had enough and has [gone right sudsy](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=478041&in_page_id=1811) in protest of all of the crap we throw into it.

I'm sure we are all familiar of the very natural occurrence of a huge wall of foam on top of the ocean for 30 miles?  Of course we are, it happens all of the time.  See the children as they frolic in the suds as we did when we were just knee high to a mutant turtle.  Oh the memories.

Holy crap batman!  What the heck is that?  Why are people playing in it?  That's not natural, that's the end of the world!  Why doesn't anybody else see that?  Hm, let's see, giant wall of dirty foam appears on the ocean?  Possibly the end of the natural food chain?  Let's play in it!  Too bad we can't surf, eh?

The bubbles will come and smother us all, people.  We will die horribly, giggling because they tickle so much.  Mark my words.

I saw this on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2007/08/28/pacific-whipped-into-an-ocean-of-froth/), by the way.
