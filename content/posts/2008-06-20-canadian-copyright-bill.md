I don't usually get too politicky, but this does seem to be a fairly serious boner move on behalf of the Canadian Government.Â  They are introducing legislation that makes silly things illegal like making a backup copy of a DVD, and transferring it to things like your iPod.Â  Downloading music is in there too, of course.Â  The list of stupid things goes on and on, but in the end the best thing to do is to go [here](http://www.copyrightforcanadians.ca/action/firstlook/) and send your MP an email about it.Â  It's a form letter, there's no hard thinking involved.Â  It takes about 20 seconds, providing you know who your MP is (and if you don't you can look him/her up there).

[Get on it, it will probably help](http://www.copyrightforcanadians.ca/action/firstlook/).

Here's [a good series of articles](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3041/125/) on how this bill would change our lives.Â  It's kind of surprising.
