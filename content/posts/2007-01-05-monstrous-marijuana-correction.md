If you remember [I picked up a story](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/10/13/10-foot-tall-dope-plants-stump-troops/) about how the pot plants in Afghanistan grew to monstrous proportions and were impossible to kill?  Well, it turns out that this is probably an exaggeration of the truth.  [Slate has a good article](http://www.slate.com/id/2156917/fr/rss/) on how "factual liberties" in drug stories are never corrected, unlike medical stories or financial stories, etc.

So there you go, the mutant monster marijuana plants of Afghanistan are probably just regular pot plants.Â  Huh.Â  It just doesn't have the same ring, does it?
