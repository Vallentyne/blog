In what must be a rather bad joke by now, a woman was sleeping in the car while her husband drove her and their son along a highway in Alberta.Â  She apparently had a bad dream and screamed out loud, which startled her husband so badly he lost control of the vehicle and they ended up rolling the car several times and ending up in the ditch.Â  Nobody was badly hurt, but something tells me that the husband will have some decidedly different habits on their next road trip.Â  Namely:Â  not having those eight capuccinosÂ before setting out on their drive.Â  Also, perhaps sitting down together and watching that 80's horror movie marathon the night before might have been a bad idea.
