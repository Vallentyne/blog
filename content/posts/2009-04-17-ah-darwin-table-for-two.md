![Hairless Chimp](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hairlessmkb0416.jpg)
Sweet gentle Jesus.

Some thoughts:



	  * Pay no mind to this simian's lack of underwear, that is probably the least disturbing thing about the picture, and that fact alone will wreck you for at least 3 hours.
	  * This chimpanzee has no hair.
	  * He seems lost in thought.Â  Probably wondering if he should wear a belt.
	  * It's a chimpanzee.Â  WTF?
	  * It's not an ad for a [razor](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/05/08/updated-bodygrooming-marketing/), (I don't think).
	  * As a [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/richu/3196188065/) commenter noted, he could use some moisturizer, his elbows look a little dry.
	  * Cover up his head, and it's your creepy old Uncle whoever, or that guy in the locker room who just won't wear a damn towel.
	  * Some random Boing Boing comments:

	    * That picture is one application of clown makeup away from the perfect nightmare fuel.
	    * Anyone who doubts evolution needs to see this photo.
	    * Great, another ape with less body hair than me.



Saw it on the [Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/04/16/xeni-i-think-were-go.html), had to share it immediately.Â  It's the most amazing, strange, disturbing, memorable, thought provoking picture I have seen in a while.
