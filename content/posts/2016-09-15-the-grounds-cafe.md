Nikki and I took some time this morning to go and visit a local coffee shop (not a Starbucks!) and man, what a treat it was.Â  The Grounds Cafe is just around the corner from us, and man is it an awesome coffee shop.Â  They serve local coffee, have fantastic bagels and cream cheese, free wifi, lots of room for chatting, what's not to love?
