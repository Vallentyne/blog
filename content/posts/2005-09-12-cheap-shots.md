I'm slightly name-sensitive, after all not only do I have a distinctive last name, but I also have what is more commonly a girl's first name.  It's not that I dislike my name, rather the opposite, it's a source of pride.  So don't sweat it, Mom.

Anyway I noticed this article and it struck a chord.  A local British records office started compiling a list of names that fly a little off the beaten handle.  I mean, these are my people.  Some genuinely good ones; Freke Dorothy Fluck Lane and Gentle Fudge are probably my favourites.  I mean, come on, Gentle Fudge?  Those are some sick parents.

[Enjoy](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050912/ap_on_fe_st/britain_odd_names).
