We spent some time at Mom's trailer this weekend and had a good time in spite of the rain, maybe due to the fact that we were lucky enough to be able to play [Rock Band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band_(video_game)) when the rain did come down. Just ask Nikki how long I have been whining about this, she will tell you. Well I have never played until now and with the help of some helpful cousins the lads and I were rocking out with, um varying degrees of success. It's the best family game I could imagine. Maybe Santa will provide this year?

Here's a couple is shots from the jam session.
