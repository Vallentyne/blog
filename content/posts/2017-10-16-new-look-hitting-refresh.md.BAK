This blog is as dusty as a really dusty thing.

To that end, I'm changing the theme around today in an effort to relieve myself from the pressure of writing on here.  ![](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0037.jpg)


I must have some mental block because I just never write here.  Anyway maybe if I just put stupid things here for a while, the posts will keep flowing.  Here's Kevin trying something new, I'm taking a page from his book.

That's it.
