So this morning Nikki and I were working out.Â  We are slowly getting back on track after she hurt her wrist and I ended up (in theory) defeating the [viral invader of last week](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/04/23/my-body-is-possessed/).Â  So, after a week off I am a little off my game, let's say.Â  Perhaps not quite up to the same level of strength as I was.Â  It also doesn't help that we just started Phase 2 of P90X and it's remarkably different from Phase 1.Â  Anyway, I am struggling with these sets, dripping with sweat as I normally do.Â  I suppose I may have made a grunt of effort, or perhaps a groan.Â  It doesn't matter what it was because just then all of my concentration, and Nikki's, it shattered by a low chuckle from off to the side.Â  Quinn has been watching me struggle with this weight and when I grunted he thought that was absolutely hilarious and started chuckling to himself.Â  Nikki starts laughing too, and I'm still trying to finish my set.Â  Do you have any idea how hard that is?

Then, in the purest innocence of a 5 year old, he deigns to tell me:

"Dad, you're pretty strong.Â  You don't look strong, but you're pretty strong."

Sigh.Â  I don't look strong, eh?Â  I told him thank you, I think.

Humility is best taught by your children, I suppose.
