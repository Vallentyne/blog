This absolutely made my day yesterday, along with about 42 kazillion other people on the Internet.Â  Hard pressed to find a Muppet that isn't in this one; Janice shreds the guitar solo, and even that crazy bomber guy makes the cut.Â  I had no idea that they were still doing new Muppet stuff, is that an American thing?Â  I don't own any Queen anymore, lost to some format shift or another.Â  This video is probably enough to make me drop a couple bucks and get a greatest hits...

Mamma!Â  Mamma?

Enjoy.
