This morning I was getting ready for work and Cael was buzzing around as he usually does in the early, early morning.Â  I had showered and he watched me shave with the usual barrage of questions.Â  Then he asked to get his hair done and I obliged, lots of gel and hair spray, just the way he likes it.Â  I then offered him some "colomb" (that's the way he pronounces cologne at the moment), which he also likes.Â  I put some on too and he asked:


<blockquote>"Dad, why do you wear colomb? Is it for the ladies?"

I responded "No, I wear it for Mommy, you wear it for the ladies."Â  (What?Â  I'm not as stupid as I look here people...)

To which he responded "I wear it for Mommy too."</blockquote>


A smart man, and impossibly cute.Â  Where does he come up with stuff like "for the ladies"?
