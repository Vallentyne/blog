Jordy has been riding for a while now, but we recently moved her to the [Nepean Equestrian Park](http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/parks_recreation/facilities/rec_centres/equestrian/index_en.html), which is actually a pretty nice place to be if you like horses. Â I don't. Â Or rather, they elicit a strong reaction from my sinuses, resulting in instant revolt against the faintest whiff of horse. Â But I digress. Â Jordy has been riding and she loves it in a way that no other activity ever has. Â Soccer, numerous dance classes, swimming, they all pale in comparison. Â She is also quite good at it, which doesn't hurt one bit. Â 

After moving to the new horse farm, she of course is now riding a new horse during her lessons. Â Despite the horse looking quite majestic and regal (in a sinus-filling way), it seems that it is rather a moron. Â It seems she had the unfortunate luck of drawing a horse that is at least 90% mule. Â She was VERY frustrated after her first lesson, it seems that the style of riding she was learning previously was not quite up to the standards of the new place. Â Added on to that was the horse, who was determined to do things his own way, and not listen to Jordy at all. Â After that fateful day we asked Jordy if she wanted us to see if we could get her a new horse to maybe help out a bit. Â She refused, and has made it her personal goal to master that horse at all costs. Â It seems that the horse is not the only stubborn one. Â So far it seems to be working out, her recent lessons have gone much better.

Her only request? Â A riding crop.... Â Probably all the better to "school" her new horse.
