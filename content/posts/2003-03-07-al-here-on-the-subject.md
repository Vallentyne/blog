Al here. On the subject of skating rinks, all I have to say is: my new favorite drink is DiSaronno on ice. Soooooo yummy!  Lovely with OJ as well. I shall bring a bottle to the next skating party and you can all try it. Except maybe Andrea, who in her delicate condition (congrats!) may just want to stick to champagne ;-)

Here's a corollary topic: Will there still be a skating rink after the chicken pox quarantine is done, I'm back from the ski trip to NY, and Andrea has patented the unborn-baby belly helmet? Discuss.
