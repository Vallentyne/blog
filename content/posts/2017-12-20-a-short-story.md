It was exceptionally windy this morning. Cael took Kevin out for his morning rituals and came back inside (Kevin doesn't really take very long now that it's cold). By chance the front door didn't latch fully, and equally by chance it didn't open up until after Cael came back up stairs.

That left Lloyd laying in the hallway.

Watching an open door.

To the outdoors.

Out side.

However it seems that his laziness combined with his love for breakfast managed to overpower his inborn need to run and play in the Carp River.

This is how I found him.

A very good boy indeed.
