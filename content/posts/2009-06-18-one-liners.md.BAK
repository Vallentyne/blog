The best part about the Internet is how it self-organizes information into ever more useful forms all the time.Â  For example, Wikipedia is a wonderful crazy source of semi-reliable information, there's never a dull moment there.Â  YouTube has replaced America's Funniest Home videos a thousandfold.Â  [LimerickDB](http://limerickdb.com) distills the best limericks in the world into one fascinating place (we [already talked about](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/02/13/limerickdb/) that one).

Now I have found [www.onelinerz.net](http://www.onelinerz.net) and I was compelled to spend at least 10 minutes reading the [top 100 list](http://www.onelinerz.net/top-100-funny-one-liners/).Â  Some of these have been gleaned from countless joke email forwards, but most I have never heard before.Â  It's like a gold mine for the people who actually create those pointless email jokes, I have no idea who they might be and what makes them tick, but man, they work hard, don't they?

Anyway, good work Internet, keep organizing useless data for me to basically ignore after I find it.

I saw the link on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2009/06/16/100-funny-one-liners/).
