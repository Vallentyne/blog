The rink is really really open at the house now.  Good Neighbour Jim has logged some serious hours and is completely responsible for making it happen this year.  We are "ahead of schedule" in the sense that the past two years we never even started the rink until after new years.  It's bigger than before too, 85'x45'.  Yes, folks that's a damn big backyard rink, and yes it takes forever to shovel and flood.  It's in top shape right now in spite of (or due to) the adverse weather conditions recently.  So, if you are of the skating mind, we will be having our skating party this year, sometime in February I think.  If you can't wait, and you know GN Jim, then he's having a game of shinny on Saturday, 2pm start.  We probably won't be home, but don't let that stop you....

Later.
