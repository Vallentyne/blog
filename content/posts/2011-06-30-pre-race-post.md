In a fit of stupidity earlier this month I registered to run my first actual race, the Kanata [Canada Day 10k](http://www.runottawaclub.ca/events/calendar/28th-annual-canada-day-road-races/).Â  As with most of these things as I registered I was stoked and fired up with the drive to kick some butt on my first race.Â  I still had four long weeks to get my aging body into race shape.Â  Besides, I had already started running this year and was feeling cocky about my fitness level (as measured by running alone of course).

The weeks went by and I was getting some runs in, maybe not as many as I had hoped, but I will catch up and really log some serious klicks (I told myself).Â  More time passed, with runs fitfully scattered in a very irregular fashion here and there.Â 

So today I decided to take stock of my training (in an effort to make myself feel better about how I will do tomorrow) and it seems that I decided unconsciously to only run 10 times this year before running a real race.Â  What?Â  That can't be right.Â  Even worse, of those 10 runs, only 4 of them even come close to 10k.Â  So, needless to say this did the exact opposite of making me feel good about tomorrow, it made me feel way worse.

You can mock my feeble efforts to date here:

Yes, that isn't enough training.Â  No, I don't think I will "kick butt" tomorrow.Â  Yes, I do think the other racers will be better prepared.Â  No, I shouldn't just be sitting here typing and drinking root beer, but it's too late now.

So there you go, a little pre-race guilt freakout for your reading pleasure.Â  I promise to report back after the race and let you know what lack of preparation gets you.

On another note, I found a great running blog today:Â  [Science-Based Running](http://sciencebasedrunning.com/)Â Â  Go and check it out, it's really good stuff.
