Once upon aÂ time I was pretty stoked about [another mobile device](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/01/09/apple-products-release/), which now seems so very very boring.Â Â These days I'm completely and totally stoked about the Windows Phone 8.1 release.Â  I mean really stoked.Â  I've been really obsessively checking for the developer release bits the last couple of days, since there was a moment in time where folks thought that might show up today.Â  However, it seems that I need to stop hitting update every 30 minutes or so, since this guy know a lot more about the release than I do:


<blockquote>Yowza, you're going nuts 4 [#WP8](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WP8&src=hash).1 dev preview. Everyone relax thru weekend, check in early next week. Enjoy Win8.1 update, write apps! :)

So I can perhaps give the Internet a rest for the weekend, and probably stop checking.Â  Still incredibly stoked though, in a way that that other phone company used to get me excited for.
