Hello fellow Vallentynes and friends,

May I be the first to give a Blogger welcome to the newest member of our clan, Cael Evan.  Finally, you have arrived, and we are thrilled!!!

"Victorious people", indeed!  I would say your parents are just that, having added you to an already wonderful family.  How lucky we all are!

I am glad that the Blogger is back up and running, and that the pictures finally have been updated.  Not that I don't like seeing Rob wearing that ... thing... but really.

Happy New Year to all!
