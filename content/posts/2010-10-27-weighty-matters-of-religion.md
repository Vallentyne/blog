One thing that has really fascinated (and disgusted) me lately is the complete explosion (implosion?) of organized religion.Â  I don't really think that any religion has much to offer me personally, but I certainly have no problem with other folks taking what they like from it, as long as there isn't any harm to others in it.Â  Generally, "Don't be a dick" (unless you are a Dick, you know what I'm getting at here Darcy, Drew, and all of the other excellent Dicks I have met) is my only commandment, and the only one I expect from others.

Even with my nonreligious viewpoint however, the stance taken by many conservative religious figures that gays and lesbians and, well, anybody that doesn't "look right" can't be a part of their religion, or in fact might even be evil or broken in some way, is an enormous failure when viewed in the cold light of business.Â  The bottom line is: if nobody comes to your church and gives you money, you are out of business.Â  It just doesn't make sense to turn anyone away when there are (it seems to me) an enormous number of other churches they can take their business to.Â  I suppose your church could be thriving BECAUSE you hold a certain viewpoint (gays are evil, for example), but why would you limit your potential customer base in any way?Â  If the whole point is to get as many butts into your seats on Sunday, that doesn't make any sense to me.Â  It's a really interesting thing to watch, and while I hope it doesn't get any crazier, when I saw this post come across the feed reader, I was left with the sense that this guy, at least, gets it.Â  This kind of attitude (to my heretical mind) is the ONLY way to really succeed in our society as a churchy guy.

He calls it a manifesto, and man, is it ever.Â  It's a firecracker of a read.


<blockquote>I have made a decision. I will no longer debate the issue of  homosexuality in the church with anyone. I will no longer engage the  biblical ignorance that emanates from so many right-wing Christians  about how the Bible condemns homosexuality, as if that point of view  still has any credibility.</blockquote>


I strongly suggest you [check it out](http://walkingwithintegrity.blogspot.com/2009/10/manifesto-from-our-friend-bishop-john.html), it's the sanest viewpoint from someone even remotely associated with a church I have seen recently.Â  I cannot comment on how valid his Bishop credentials are as I'm not really qualified there, but man, it's fun to read.
