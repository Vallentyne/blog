Oh, hi!
I didn't see you there.  How long have you been sitting there waiting to read something new?

Well, aside from the usual emotional roller coaster ride that we are on, with unloading the Sentra and getting a van, there isn't much new here outside of the regular chaos.

One exciting thing is that Quinn is actually turning two this week.  Friday to be exact.  We are looking forward to celebrating with some family, grandparents, and godparents, that sort of thing.  I'm doing my best to ignore the fact that two whole years has passed me by and I didn't even see it happening.  I swore to myself that I would pay attention.  I would not let time pass so easily with Quinn like it has with Jordy.  Unfortunately I've learned that it isn't something that is in your power to control.  It's bittersweet.  Jordy is a young lady, and Quinn is talking.  They are their own little persons now and not the babies I, only briefly, knew.  As for Cael, well he's 21 pounds and change.  I don't remember a time when he was anything less than a hernia maker.  I guess birthing toddlers will do that.

So, here's to some Bob the Builder birthday fun coming up, and cheers to our little man.  He's almost two.
