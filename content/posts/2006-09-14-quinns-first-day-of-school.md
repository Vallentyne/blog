Well this week has seen a lot of firsts (Cael's first day of pre-school, the boy's first swimming lesson) and today is no exception.  Quinn finally had his first day of junior kindergarten today, after lots and lots of anticipation.  It went off swimmingly, he was extraordinarily cute of course.  Here's a few shots from this morning:
