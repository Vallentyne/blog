[Scientifically created low odour cow crap](http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2005/050329.htm)

[Dog crap spray](http://www.creativematch.co.uk/viewnews/?91254)

and last but not least the aptly named [Poopsadaisy](http://www.cleverpetproducts.com/catalog.asp?prodid=451291), a sort of crap pocket for dogs.

And just in case you wondered, I steal all of this crap from [other](http://gizmodo.com) [smarter](http://www.boingboing.net) blogs.
