What kind of scares me is that this guy just seems to be making it up as he goes along.  Then he gets caught in an attempt like this one to be  authoritative and gumpy and the facade cracks right away, check out [his expression](http://news.yahoo.com/photo/051120/photos_ts/2005_11_20t084730_450x319_us_bush_china_doors;_ylt=AnZdCJ92xfHD8XY8j8UScYcb.3QA;_ylu=X3oDMTA3bGk2OHYzBHNlYwN0bXA-) when he's trying to open the doors, it's like he's mocking himself on a sitcom.  Is there a serious bone in his body?  It's scary to know how flippant he is and then think of some of the decisions he has made.
