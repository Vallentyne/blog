Welcome to the world of photocopy hell, brother.  Every single work day of my life I have fought this battle.  It is a well-known fact that photocopiers were invented for the sole purpose of destroying the sanity of its users, one sheet of paper at a time.  There is Chinese Water Torture and then there is Photocopier Torture.  It is obvious which one is more damaging.  We have gone beyond a first name basis with our copier repairman - Bill now has a suite here on site and valet parking.

Collated we stand, sorted we fall.  Duplexed we are simply screwed.
