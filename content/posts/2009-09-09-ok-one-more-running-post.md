I [said I wasn't going to post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/09/02/last-run-update/) about running any more, but maybe just one more.

At least two things have occurred to me recently while running:Â  you don't generally want to use the earbuds you wear running in non-running situations, and carrying your iPhone in your sweaty hand while running is awkward, dangerous and often disgusting.

First off, running with earbuds in is a necessity.Â  The problem is that when I run, my ears head everything sweats and so the earbuds are in contact with said sweat.Â  Then, once I am all showered and ready for work, the thought of putting those earbuds into my clean ears gives me the willies.Â  I have a mental image of my smelly ears emitting twin visible vapour trails of BO behind me as I walk around at work.Â  So, I will therefore be buying a set of cheap earbuds for exclusive use while running.Â  Problem solved.

Next is the necessity of carrying the iPhone while running.Â  I never purchased a belt clip, case or anything I can use to fasten the iPhone to my person, so if I want to track my runs I need to carry the iPhone in my hand as I run.Â  This becomes an issue since as you can imagine my hand gets a tad sweaty and my grip on the phone becomes a little precarious.Â  An armband is the ticket, for sure.Â  This decision is a bit harder, since there are a ton of options out there.Â  Haven't decided yet, but I think I like [this one](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/streamlineiphone#).

That's it, no more running posts.
