Blog posts are as scarce as hen's teeth around here.

Fortunately (well, unfortunately for her) I know I'm only disappointing Mom when there's nothing new on the blog.  But there is today, and some very interesting news for [Pastafarians](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/08/heathen_like_me.html) to boot.  First off, the big shocker, is that noodles as a food are much much older than previously thought.  This [article from the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4335160.stm) shows that 4000 year old noodles were discovered in China.  The researchers there were amazed and delighted to find the noodles underneath a bowl perfectly intact.  They were reported to be a little overcooked, and a little too starchy, but otherwise delicious.

Then the discovery of a new [noodly life form](http://www.fred.net/tds/noodles/noodle.html), which exists and thrives only in pots of boiling water, rigatoni and penne rigate.  Incredible news, and it also supports the theory of Intelligent Design, which should make science teachers in Kansas very happy.  

Quite a week for science.
