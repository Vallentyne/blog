In case you needed proof that Nikki is a super Mom, this should serve nicely.  Check out the crazy cake skills she's showing off here with Cael's cake.  It only took her about 2.5 hours to do this, and I think it's mighty impressive.  And to think that she doubted herself yesterday...

Quinn and Jordy had so much fun watching Mom make this that they got to stay up later than usual and watch the creation.  It was lots of advice and company for Nikki, that much is sure.   Way to go baby.
