As usual I have mentioned [these before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/10/the_shining_tha.html), but I thought it would be good to revisit.

The first was The Shining, incredibly remixed into a feel good father-son story.  The I saw West Side Story remixed into a zombie horror movie.  These guys have talent, and a lot of time on their hands.  So, I thought I might go looking for more.  Man, that was a mistake.  Here you go, and kiss a half hour away, at least.

[Ten Things I Hate About Comandments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1kqqMXWEFs) - The Ten Commandments as a teen comedy, hilarious.  This one came across Boing Boing today and started my little search.

[Sleepless in Seattle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYHyYt_YVdU) -  now a suspense thriller

[Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU820oNIscA) - now a scary horror movie

[The Sound of Music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26lEER3Pyr0) - as a wartime drama

[The Big Lebowski](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9y8-3qoHc) - another suspense movie, very very funny.

There are many many more, this is just a small sample.  Very fun stuff to watch.
