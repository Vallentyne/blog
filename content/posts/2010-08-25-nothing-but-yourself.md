**_why try to impress? Why try to be more?_**

**_Why try to be better than you were before?_**

**_What need do you have, to prove who you are?_**

**_Just being proud of yourself is the best thing by far._**

**_Their opinions don't matter, it's how you're feeling inside,_**

**_stop trying to impress, live your life with pride._**

**_Being true to yourself is the best thing to do,_**

**_as long as you're living, be proud to be you._**
