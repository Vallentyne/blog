Unsolicited ad copy for [PropertyPlus.ca](http://propertyplus.ca):

Neighbours making you crazy? Â Entering the witness relocation program? Â Just got out of prison? Â Starting a new lifestyle in to/out of the city/country? Â Sick of renting a slum, or interested in owning one? Â Have a light bulb you don't feel like changing? Â 

Then you must be thinking of buying or selling a home...

The next time you are buying or selling a house, you owe it to yourself to head on over to PropertyPlus.ca and save yourself some money that would otherwise go to some slick smarmy real estate agent to use for his BMW lease, or for his hair gel.

It doesn't cost a cent to just list your home on the website, but then you wouldn't get a spiffy lawn sign for kids to kick/steal/egg/burn.

So come on down and get yourself some new digs!

Â 

Caveat: Â I do not write advertising material for a living. Â I think it shows.
