Man, did you see this one?  This is really creepy stuff.  

They have finally managed to photograph one of these [giant squids](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/photogalleries/giant_squid/index.html) in the water, and it's a big 'un.  They estimate it was 26 feet long after wrestling with it for a few minutes and getting away with a tentacle to show the boys back at the lab.  It's not the biggest on record (59 feet), but it's still a little too big for comfort.

That's pretty freaking unsettling if you ask me.

But, not as unsettling as the thought of even bigger squids, with 'tude.  That's attitude, for the non-urbanites out there.  Some further research (oh I worked hard on this people, it's on the same website as the link above) turned up[ this article](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0423_030423_seamonsters.html) that talks of "colossal squid" that have hooked tentacles and a huge beaked mouth and prey on the pleasure craft of the rich.  Ok, I made that last part up, and they may not be all that dangerous, but it's still pretty freaking cool to think about these real life sea monsters.
