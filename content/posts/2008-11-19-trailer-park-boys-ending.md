A sad note today, [The Trailer Park Boys](http://www.trailerparkboys.com) will air the last episode of the series on December 7th, 10pm on Showcase. Â This show has been so consistently funny (although the earliest stuff is the best) Nikki and I have been fans since day one, and have bugged most of our other friends enough to at least pretend they like it too. Â I think I will be asking Santa for some of them on DVD because they are just too good to not have.

The lads will be missed, for sure. Â They are at least going out on top of their game.
