Even though Cael has no idea his 3rd birthday was on Sunday, I still feel the need to say, "HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY!!!!" publicly.Â  Little man had a little bit of a celebration during New Year's Day dinner at Nanny & Poppy's house.Â  It was really cute and will tide him over until the home party this weekend. We had the Herrick annual family reunion land on his birthday yesterday so we decided that while he was still too young to know any better, we'd save the home party for this coming Saturday.

So, the boys and I just came back from Bulk Barn (love that place) with a cake mix and some special icing to make Cael's "Frosty The Snowman" cake.Â  Ironically enough, in the cartoon, when Frosty wakes up he says, "Happy Birthday!!!"Â  Perfect!Â  We'll see if I can make this thing actually look like my target of the 1969 cartoon we all know and love, or a snowbank.Â  That will be tonight's task, and then hide it in the freezer until Saturday.

God help me though, I'm pretty sure there is another dollar store trip in my future this week for some party favours and balloons, etc.Â  Keep your fingers crossed that the Kanata Fire Department isn't called in for another false alarm!
