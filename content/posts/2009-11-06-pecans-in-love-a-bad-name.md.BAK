A one-shot VallenQuiz today.

Cael was singing the other day, mostly to himself.Â  Nikki and I caught each other's eye, and asked him to sing that song again.Â  This is what I got, before I couldn't see any longer from the tears.

Shock a la hah and you're too lame
Pecans in love, a bad name
Peanut squaw, and a videogame
Pecans in love, a bad name

The song should be easily recognizable to anyone alive during the 80's.Â  I had no idea that song was about nuts, however.
