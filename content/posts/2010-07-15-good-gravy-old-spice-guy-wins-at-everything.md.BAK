Not content to just make the most [memorable](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2010/07/06/new-old-spice-yes-please/) ads in recent memory that I can memorize or write a [memo](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2010/02/09/smell-like-jet-fighters-and-punching/) about, Old Spice Guy has been busy filming direct responses to people on Twitter, and the interwebs at large. Â There are too many to link to directly, but the [Old Spice channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/OldSpice) on YouTube has them, and man are they funny.

This is the most amazing bit of marketing I have ever seen. Â The cost of doing this probably wasn't even that much, but they probably had to have a team of writers to keep the quips coming. Â Brilliant work, you can't deny the wonderful creativity behind this campaign.
