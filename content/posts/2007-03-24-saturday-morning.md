The best part about going into work at 6:30am on Saturday morning is not the waking up early part.Â  Nor is it the scrape the frost off the car part.Â  It's not even the part where I realize that I am going into work to bill what will be the 75th workday out of the last 83 calendar days.Â  Or the part where I'm wondering how Nikki is doing at home alone with the kids, again.Â  Nope, not even that.Â  The best part?Â  It's when they test the fire alarm right above my desk for about 45 minutes at 7:15am.Â  I love that part.

It's my blog, I get to bitch about what I want.
