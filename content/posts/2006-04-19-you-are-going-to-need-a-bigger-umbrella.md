Remember how [I mentioned that huge chunks of ice](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/04/nasa_to_look_fo.html) were raining down on the earth?

Well, it's [still happening](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/04/14/MNGM9I9BUC8.DTL).  A chunk the size of "a microwave oven" crashed into a rec centre.  It's getting a little hard to ignore, wouldn't you say?  You can now laugh and squirm nervously.
