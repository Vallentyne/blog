I think that maybe, the [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/ca/appletv/) is now ready.Â  You can rent movies on the thing, and it does HD now, so that is starting to make a lot of sense.Â  Not sure about how many times you get to watch the movie for your rental fee just yet, but it's promising.Â  It might just make me actually start to finally throw the movies into the iTunes library.Â  A central movie library has long been a desire of mine since I consolidated the music years ago.

The other stuff is very cool, but IÂ can't buy an iPhone yet in Canada, and don't have an iPod TouchÂ so it's not that compelling just yet.

I must say the [Macbook Air](http://www.apple.com/ca/macbookair/) is awesome.Â  That thing is so thin, it's incredible.Â  I wonder how sturdy it is though.Â  The tiny hard disk could get mighty old too.Â  80GB is pretty small.Â  Undoubtedly it will be impossible to buy one because they are brand new and absolutely cool.Â 

Â Oh well there you go, stuff I won't buy because I'm too damn cheap.
