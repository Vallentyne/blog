If you have ever seen [Dazed and Confused](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677/) you will instantly recognize what's going on in this video.

Matthew McConaughey (who inexplicably also stays the same damn age somehow until this very day) reprises the role he played in the movie, hilariously. Â What's more is this song is pretty darn good, and the video is really well done. Â Way cool and lots of fun.

It hardly seems fair that Mr. McConaughey manages to remain exactly the same as he looked 19 years ago, although perhaps much richer and more famouser.
