Ok, this is geeky, I will admit, but it also rocks and I think anybody would agree that it is about the coolest thing in the world.  It is also the coolest thing about the world, [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com) (ooh, look at the butter-smooth segue, damn I'm good).  If you haven't seen this thing yet run, don't walk to the website and try it out before they come to their senses and charge for it.  Actually they do charge for the advanced services, but you get the idea.  It is not only beautiful to look at, it's a complete blast to play with and gives me a god-like sense of power.  It's a completely healthy pastime.

Basically it's a view of the Earth from space, which you can dive right down into, anywhere you want.  You just grab it and spin it.  It's incredibly good use of technology, the pages stream down as you go, depending on what you look at.  You can of course search for a location, add favourite places, get directions, and a whole bunch more.  

It brings certain landmarks into view that are quite shocking, really.  I had no idea this was visible from space, when looking at our house, for instance:
