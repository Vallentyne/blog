Be afraid, be very afraid.




Cael became The Mountain That Moves back [in November](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/11/some-family-news-today.htm), but now he's The Mountain That Moves faster.  That's right folks, he is officially walking.  It's still pretty hit-or-miss but he's getting better and soon will be terrorizing a whole new audience of people he hasn't yet terrorized; People Over There.  He's been doing a bang-up job on the People Over Here up to now, but People Over There were always comfortably safe with a buffer of crawling speed to keep in mind.  Not anymore.  He couldn't be happier about the new victims, really.  It adds a whole new list of things to the arsenal, like Trample, Bodycheck, Stomp, and Kick.




It's not looking good for Quinn or Harvey, that much is certain.
