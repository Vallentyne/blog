Quinn is now ready to cast off his, er cast.  Today is the big day, Nikki and I are taking the little guy to get his cast off in a few hours.  This should be interesting, he is incredibly mobile already I can hardly wait to see how well he walks without it.  Should be good fun.  And a lot more work.




Not much more to add here today.  Nikki is bugging me about this weekend, but I won't tell her what we are doing.  I'm having a lot of fun with it, personally.  She knows we won't have any kids with us, but that is about it.  It's really good fun bugging your spouse.




Anyway, that's all I have for now.




Later.
