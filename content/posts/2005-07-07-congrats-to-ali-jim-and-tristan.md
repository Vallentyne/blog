Xavier Theodore Doucette was born today at 11:00am, landing in at 6lbs and something (sorry Jim I couldn't remember his exact weight for the life of me).  Mom and baby are doing fine.  Jim will soon recover from the involuntary fits of pride and chest puffing, I'm sure.  You must remember Jim that it's very nice that you were there, but when it's all said and done, you didn't really _do _anything.... or if you insist, nothing you haven't already been practising since puberty.

They are now officially on the road to crazy town, and I'm sure I can speak for Nikki and myself when I say "Whew!  Somebody else with young kids."  Actually, I really meant to say: Way to go, can't wait to meet the little X-man.

Xavier (providing I am spelling it correctly of course) is a very cool name, and while the poor kid will have fits his whole life spelling it for people, it will be worth it just for the joy of signing "X. Doucette".  Way cool.
