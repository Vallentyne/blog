Well it's all over but the liver damage, people.  The Christmas party is done for another year.  For those that showed up, hopefully you had a good time.  For those that didn't show, why not?  And don't give me any of that "Oh, but I'm 12 000 km away on another continent" crap.  Well, actually that's not a bad reason, but besides that one there's no good excuse.

I would like to thank Nikki for once again coordinating and orchestrating the whole evening.  She worked her butt off and it shows.  Her butt's still there, I meant that the night went very well.  I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say "Hear Hear!" and "Huzzah!" and "Nice Butt!" to the lovely and talented Nikki!  The last one was probably more or less just speaking for myself, and maybe not for all of the rest of you.

Anyway, you get the idea.  Way to go, Honey.
