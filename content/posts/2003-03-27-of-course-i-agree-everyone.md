Of course I agree. Everyone agrees with you. Everyone, that is, but the record companies. There is an interesting little story on CNN today about the similar copying of DVD's. You should read it. Apparently this company -- 321 Studios -- has developed DVD ripping software and is preemptively suing some of the entertainment industry titans.
