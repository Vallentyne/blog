Last night we were quite busy with the usual pre-first day of school preparations, getting kids showered, clothes and outfits agonized over, lunches made, etc.Â  Lloyd and Harvey were settling into the evening's long doze wherever they fell, or so we thought.Â  Lloyd was left alone in the kitchen for a period of time that apparently exceeded his limit on self-control.Â  We came back into the kitchen at the same time and were greeted by the sight of Lloyd lying next to Harvey's water dish, in the middle of a huge puddle.Â  The water was so widespread that we were unsure what had happened, thinking initially that something had fallen off the counter and landed into Harvey's full dish with a huge splash.Â  Lloyd is usually very good about Harvey's dishes and not touching them, despite his longing sighs and laying with his nose touching them.Â  Anyway, we thought he was completely innocent until I got him to sit up so I could dry him off with a towel (the water was actually beaded on his head) and he emitted a deafening burp in my direction that blew my hair back.

Busted.

The jackass didn't even have the grace to look embarrassed about it, and now I know why Harvey wouldn't leave me alone before this discovery, he was trying to tell on Lloyd and I was too stupid to get it.Â  In hindsight the mess Lloyd made was so great, he must have actually been playing in the dish with his paw, a la [backyard splashy time](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/07/31/backyard-splashy-time/).

On another note, the Globe and Mail has [an article about the cost of pet ownership](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/the-economics-of-pet-ownership/article1268270/) today.Â  I estimate it's costing me about $90/month (his food costs about exactly $2/pound) just to feed Lloyd right now, not to mention the 8 pills/day he takes at the moment to fight off a cold he picked up at the kennel.Â  It's a good thing he's adorable.Â  It might save his life.
