Nikki and I were driving back from Arnprior last night and drove past Scotia Bank Place just as the hockey game was getting out.  We had been visiting some family and so we had no idea who had won the game.  Usually there is an electronic scoreboard at the highway, but it looked like it was being replaced and was out of commission.  So Nikki had the idea of just yelling out the window to the pedestrians and ask them who won.  As we drove by some walkers at Palladium Drive at the light, Nikki rolled her window down and yelled out to one guy walking by in a Leafs jersey: "Who won the game?".  His response was not exactly friendly and involved lots of derogatory language.  We were both surprised at the rude behaviour and drove home laughing and shaking our heads at the state of society.  When we got in Nikki checked the score of the game on the web and we saw that the Sens had whipped Toronto pretty badly, 5-2.  Thinking back to the encounter with the pedestrian we reconstructed the events through his eyes:


<blockquote>

> <blockquote>After watching glumly through the whole game as his favourite team got spanked and enduring the ribbing from his friends, he was walking home to drown his sorrows.  From a passing van someone yelled out a cruel jibe:  "Who won the game?", no doubt thinking to target him for wearing a Leafs jersey.  Cruel, cruel lady.</blockquote>

Who wouldn't lash out?  :-)
