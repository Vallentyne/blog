The kids have been getting a lot of airtime these days.  I suppose that's only natural, they do outnumber us parents.  




Jordy has been taking karate lately and it's been a big hit with her.  No pun intended.  The biggest complaint has been that they make the kids do some pushups and other warmup exercises before the class starts.  She likes karate, but just don't call it exercise, ok?




Quinn is making the move into a big bed this weekend finally.  It should be quite painful for Nikki and I, no doubt.  I will have to update you later on how that went.  He is still quite the non-conformist.  For instance, he ate carrots this morning for a snack.  Not that unusual, you say?  How about the raw spanish onion he ATE LIKE AN APPLE with it?  Who is this kid?  Onions, man.  It's the kid poison.  Most kids can ferret a single piece of cooked green onion out of a whole pot of stew with their eyes closed while jamming their nose full of peas and whistling Ring Around The Rosie at the same time.  And he eats it RAW.  Wow.




Cael is good.  He has been doing better than good really.  Let me recap a bit for you.




Jan 7, born, 9lbs 5.5 oz.  

Jan 14, 9lbs 8oz  

Jan 19th, 10lbs 8oz  

Feb 1, 11lbs 15oz  

Feb 10th, 13lbs 1oz  

Feb 18th, 14lbs 12oz




That's 5 lbs, 6.5oz gained in 6 weeks.  Almost a pound a week.  For crying out loud, this kid is huge, and getting huger.  He's going to outweigh Quinn soon.




Have a good weekend.
