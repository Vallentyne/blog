Let's play a little game.Â  We went to dinner last night at Dairy Queen.Â  Here are some things that were overheard during dinner, the first person to correctly identify all three quotes, or which Vallentyne said what gets a pony, or bragging rights, whichever is cheaper.



	  1. In the Dairy Queen bathroom: Oh man, this isn't going to be good.Â  Dad, I'm not sure if this is going to be ok.Â  This isn't my aim-y hand...
	  2. In the restaurant:Â  We are doing diaries in school now.Â  Too bad it's not diarrheas!Â  (followed by five minutes of solid, red-faced giggling)
	  3. Watching a man walk in with a yellow t-shirt and matching yellow and brown plaid pajama pants: Worst. Pants. Ever.

In fact, I will post a picture of a member of our family acting like a total baby when I get the first right answer.Â  You have to get all three right.Â  Go!

**Update:Â  Ok, so Lockrey got it right away, figures.Â  As promised, here's a pic of Lloyd being a baby.Â  That's a pacifier in his mouth....
