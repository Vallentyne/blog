Dear Toes,

I trust that this note finds you and yours well.Â  I am writing to you in an effort to mend our long relationship (37 years! wow) and I hope you will find it in your cuticles to read it with an open mind.Â  I know things haven't always been great between us, we have had our ups and downs.Â  Mostly good though.Â  Remember when you got tickled almost every day when I was a kid?Â  Good times.

Anyway, when I smashed three of you yesterday in the dark when I was getting ready for work, I wasn't mad at you, it was an accident.Â  Sulking like that isn't very mature of you, and it just hurts us both.Â  I have almost smashed those same three toes twice since then, and I think you are just doing that on purpose.Â  We used to have a deal (an understanding, if you will), where I wouldn't smash you into things, and you would at least try to stay out of harm's way.Â  This business of swelling and getting red really isn't becoming, you really should stop that.Â  Deal?

Yours truly,

Courtney
