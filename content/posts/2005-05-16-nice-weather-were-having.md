I'm still here.

I was just enjoying the weather here in Canada.  Nice and unpredictable.  I had shorts and a T-Shirt, and jeans and a sweater on within two hours of each other on the weekend.  Just lovely.

Anyway, it could be worse.  I noticed the weather in space today is, well, not so nice.  It's more of a "grab a ceramic heat shield and titanium athletic support" kind of day, rather than a "shorts and t-shirt" kind of day.  Those crazy scientists (I [mentioned before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/03/heres_a_very_ne.html) how they [love to rate things](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/04/armageddon_nerd.html) that probably need no rating) have noticed that there is an electromagnetic storm raging in the cosmos today that rates a "9" on the 9 level scale they dreamed up to measure these storms.  That's "9 Scary Aliens" to you and me, or living in a microwave.

Anyway, why we need to know what the weather is like in space is sort of beyond me.  I mean unless you happen to own a satellite or live in your moon-based evil lair, it's sort of a non-event here, isn't it?
