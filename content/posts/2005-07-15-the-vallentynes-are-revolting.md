I know that's no surprise to most of you.  What I actually mean of course is that we are by necessity retreating into a shell of exclusive family time starting on Sunday, and ending sometime next week I would imagine.  

For those of you who have been over to the house this summer, please realize that this is in no way a personal thing with you, it's everybody else that is the problem.  Really, you're fine, we just can't stand everybody else.

Of course I'm completely kidding about that last part, but Nik and I decided that some dedicated family time was not just nice to have, it is a complete necessity for our own sanity.  We will re-emerge from the hiatus with renewed vigor and purpose, I promise.  Besides, next weekend is Bob and Lee's big do, and of course a social event we get to leave the house for is a big win in our books. :-)
