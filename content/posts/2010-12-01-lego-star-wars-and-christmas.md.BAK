LEGO, Star Wars and Christmas, easily the holy trinity for me and the boys, this fits into my geek psyche like magic:Â  The [LEGO Death Star Christmas Tree ornament](http://web.me.com/chrismcveigh/mintinbox/home/Entries/2010/11/29_Lego_Death_Star_Ornament.html).Â  Fantastic, and since we are decorating the tree tonight, maybe I can talk Quinn into finding these pieces to make one.Â  Way cool.
