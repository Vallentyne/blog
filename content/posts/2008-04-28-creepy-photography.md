Well, talk about taking things to a new and creepy level, I'm betting you have never seen photography quite like this:Â  [Joshua Hoffine Photography](http://joshuahoffine.com/splash.html)

Basically it seems he is using the same poor little blond girl for his model, she probably will never be quite the same after this.Â  Man there are some frigging creepy shots up there.Â  I can hear Lockrey cackling and Nikki shivering.

I just saw this today on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/04/28/childhood-fears/) and had to share.Â  Also ganked the image without permission, hopefully he won't mind.
