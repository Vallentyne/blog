Here's a very creepy NASA science project:  [Robotic girlfriends for lonely geeks](http://ndeaa.jpl.nasa.gov/nasa-nde/biomimetics/Biomimetic-robot-Hanson.mov).

Or, actually it seems to be a robotic receptionist.  But in actual fact, it's the creepiest thing I have seen in a while.  The video is long and unedited, but watch for the horrible smile about halfway through, it's really really unsettling.  Anyway, it's really hard to watch.

So, there you have it, the latest installment in "Apocalypse Soon".  It's not long before these machines will rise against us, tossing their flowing locks and snarling as they cheerfully help us find our final resting place.
