Things I've learned this week:

1. Purple crayons are most fun when used on windows, walls, counters, cupboards, tables and floors.

2. Purple crayon comes off of said surfaces with Fantastik with bleach and Windex

3. 8 years olds interpret "watch your brother" as "Watch TV"

4. 2 year olds pay close attention to where the crayons are kept.

5. 2 year olds are very aware of when Mommy is around vs. when 8 year olds are in charge.

6. A trip to Andrew  Hayden Park can be quickly replaced with Fantastik with Bleach and a rag.

7. 2 year olds like to put ride-on toys on the couch and practice pop-a-wheelies.

8. Above event can be done inside of 20 seconds. (enough time to take infant upstairs and come back for the second one)

9. Husbands find great composure when being told of numbers 1-8 out of fear of death.

10. 7 month olds can pull chest hair with their toes.  (Wives find great composure when being told of #10)
