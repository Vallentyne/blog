Let me share something with you.

I have been considering something for quite a while now, and yesterday I decided to act on it.  I have long considered becoming a professional exotic dancer, but yesterday I finally took some steps towards that goal.  I quit my job and enrolled in "Dick Rizzo's Chippendale Dancing Academy".  We start our first class tomorrow, and I'm stoked.  It's gonna be great.  I really think this will be my niche.  Anyway I still have to get some school supplies today so I should go.  What's left?  hm, body grease, hair gel, 7 pounds of hair removal wax, a dozen g-strings (not the guitar kind), fake mole, "bling bling" gold chain, and leopard skin robe.  Yep that should do it.

Later.
