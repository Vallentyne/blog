Time to get your geek on.

We here at Mundane Ramblings know that sometimes you just _have _to know what Lloyd ate next, or just what hilarious thing <insert child's name here> said today, or even just how geeky Courtney is today.Â  These Ramblings are critical and many, many of you have asked for an enhanced mobile experience.Â  After an extensive R&D period, and untold efforts (I actually took about five minutes to find a Wordpress plugin that does this), we are pleased to announce the new mobile Ramblings!Â  Just hit the blog with your phone and gaze in wonder at the mobile-ey goodness.Â  Because sometimes you just need your Ramblin's wherever the heck you are at.

We aim to please, so let us know how close we got.
