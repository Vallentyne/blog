Yeah, that title hurt my head to write, but this song hurts it more. Â It's just what it looks like: Â a clown singing The Who's Pinball Wizard to the tune of Johnny Cash's Folsom Prison Blues. Â I'm not here to judge, but you probably didn't know you needed this in your life. Â You did. Â And once you hear this, like me, you won't hear either song exactly the same way again. Â It's weird. Â And that clown can sing, actually.

It's from [Puddles Pity Party](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbs7cZ6EdgXgZYL5LDoor2A), what can only be described as an eclectic YouTube channel. Â But there's something going on here, it's kinda awesome in a weird way.

I saw this on Boing Boing too, which is no surprise by now.
