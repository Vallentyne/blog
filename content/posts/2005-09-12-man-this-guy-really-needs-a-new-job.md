[Excellent and scary article](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9287434/) about the Bush administration reaction to Katrina.  I mean, the guy has an aide make a custom DVD of the news so he can watch it.  Why doesn't he doesn't just turn on a TV?

Wow, he's so bad at this president thing, it's almost surreal.
