<blockquote>
The Laundry Song (to the tune of Fire and Rain by James Taylor)


> 
> Just yesterday morning I put another load on
seems like I get it done, and then thereâ€™s just more to do.
I walked out this morning to the line I put clothes on

Wouldnâ€™t ya know,â€¦their soaked with dew

Ooooh in my dryer Iâ€™ve seen change
I've had days of doing laundry that I thought would never end
I've seen socks that could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd find the match again

Won't you look at this stain, Jesus!
This shirt is covered in jam.
I've got just enough Tide for one more day
My body's aching and so are my hands
Iâ€™ve drank two bottles of wine today.

Ooooh in my dryer Iâ€™ve seen change
I've had days of doing laundry that I thought would never end
I've seen socks that could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd the match again

Been pinning my gitch to this line, back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it will spin your gitch around
Well, there's hours of time on the frigginâ€™ clothes line to pin things dusk to dawn
after winds have blown and flying PJâ€™s in pieces on the ground

Ooooh in my dryer Iâ€™ve seen change
I've had days of doing laundry that I thought would never end
I've seen socks that could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd the match again</blockquote>


That's just too good.
