I lost more of my morning than I care to admit clicking through the Flash animations on [this site](http://www.biteycastle.com/html.shtml).  Some serious talent, with a good eye for character and story, these little [movies](http://www.biteycastle.com/content/animation.php) are really compelling and fun to watch.

The centrepieces are the ones that focus on Bitey, especially [Littlefoot](http://www.biteycastle.com/littleFoot.html) and the followup [The Yuyu](http://www.biteycastle.com/theYuyu.html).  Watch them in order, it's important.  I also enjoyed [Taken](http://www.biteycastle.com/taken.htm), which has a high jump out of your chair factor.

Too cool.
