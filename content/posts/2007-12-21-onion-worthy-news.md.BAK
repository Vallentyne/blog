Some things just write themselves.  [This Canoe article ](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/12/12/4720520-ap.html)looks like it came right from the pages of The Onion.  A Dunkin Donuts worker clocks a guy robbing the store with a coffee mug because he was worried he might look like a dork on Youtube if he didn't.

It's interesting how this connected world of ever increasing surveillance is changing our behaviour, even in times of stress.  I can't honestly say I would be all that worried about Youtube myself.  Maybe I'm just an old fart?
