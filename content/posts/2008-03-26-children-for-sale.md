Well, not ours actually.

The topic of adoption came up at dinner this week.Â  We were discussing (of all things) marriage and how any two people can get married, but you need a man and a woman to have babies.Â  Unless of course you adopt, I said.Â  I asked Quinn if he knew what adoption was.Â  Oh sure, he said.Â  It's when you buy a kid, you know, if it's for sale.Â  He said it so off-handedly, like discussing whether or not there was a sale on milk that day.Â  We laughed so hard, I was crying.

Then Cael pipes up and says in his best sneering English accent that he saw a commercial about the "famous Harry Pot-TER" and basically that was it for dinner time decorum.Â  These guys are frigging funny.
