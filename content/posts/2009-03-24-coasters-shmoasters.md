Having recently mustered the courage to ride the [Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland](http://behemoth.canadaswonderland.com/public/news/), I thought I was a tough guy.Â  Sure, I can handle it, two or three times, even.Â  I can swagger around and tell everyone how cool I am, cause I am.Â  Just. That. Cool.




That is until these [pictures of bigger, nastier, scarier roller coasters](http://www.trifter.com/Practical-Travel/Adventure-Travel/Mega-and-Giga-Coasters-Worlds-Scariest-Highest-and-Fastest-Roller-Coasters.585507) made my stomach flip and do a very un-cool gurgle.Â  I mean, look at this one, it's beyond scary.Â  That's batshit insane.

This one, called Kingda Ka is at Six Flags in New Jersey.Â  It's 456 feet tall, and hits 128 mph, which makes your face actually flatter after riding it.Â  You need to wear a special mouth guard to keep your cheeks from flapping too much, it's basically a soother since you will be crying like a baby afterward (probably).Â  Think about that, the Behemoth is only 230 feet tall and **_only _**does 77 mph....Â  man, that's humbling.




So, I will now stop feeling like I'm all that, since there are much scarier coasters out there that I haven't ridden.... or ever will hopefully.
