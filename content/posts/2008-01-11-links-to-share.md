I am playing with a little addition to the blog today.Â  I use [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader) to track the sites I follow regularly, and it does a fine job of reading and marking things of interest for later.Â  They have long offered a way to share links of interest, but to be honest I never really bothered to set it up.Â  Well what do you know, it's kind of neat.Â  So a little hacking around and there you have it: a not so ugly box in the sidebar with the last few things I thought you may want to read about, but which I haven't actually blogged about.Â  Hope you find something of interest in there sometimes.
