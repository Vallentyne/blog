I shouldn't be writing a post at this point in time probably, seeing as the news that hit me at the bus stop today is a little too fresh to write anything with an objective tone.  

Today had the promise of innocence and fun. I put our kids on their bus and off to school they went.  No one had a worry in their heads.  I was at the bus stop with Cael on my hip to pick up Quinn and my neighbour says, "So what do you think about the commotion at the school this week?"  Oblivious to what was going on, I asked what she was talking about.  As it turns out a grade six boy made the threat of bringing a gun into the school to kill all the girls that wore glasses in his class.  

The story I heard was that someone broke up with him and this was going to be the payback.  I also heard that one of our neighbours' kids was third on this person's list.  If that doesn't make you instantly ill and leave you with a permanent knot in your stomach I don't know what would.  Needless to say the second we got in the door from the bus we had a very long, tight hug.  

The school had actually sent home a note lumped in with the newsletter yesterday assuring parents the threats were being taken seriously and there was police involvement along with threat response teams working the situation.  I saw the newsletter, ripped the calendar of events off the back and set the rest of the letter down on my couch side table to read when I had time.  Somehow the library funding, and little Susie's big break to the public speaking finals that I assumed would be in there wasn't demanding my time.  I'll be paying much closer and immediate attention from now on, this I can assure you.

Thankfully I had a cooking class planned for the boys and I this afternoon and we had some Cinnamon Crackle Cookies to take our mind off of things, at least for a little while anyway. 

I know it has been said a million times before but I'll say it again... 

What is this world coming to?
