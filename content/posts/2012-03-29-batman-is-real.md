Man, I have to say that this is some of the most selfless, amazing and genuine goodwill I have ever heard of.Â  This guy dresses up as Batman and visits terminally (or seriously) ill kids in hospitals.

He's got a Lamborghini kitted out as the Batmobile (until his $250 000 custom made car is ready), has a professionally made Batman suit, the whole deal.Â  He recently got some Internet attention because he [got pulled over by the police ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-buzz/post/batman-pulled-over-in-silver-spring/2012/03/23/gIQAzjmPWS_blog.html)for not having his regularÂ plates onÂ while in costume, which prompted [this article about his reasons for dressing as Batman](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/rosenwald-md/post/who-is-the-route-29-batman-this-guy/2012/03/28/gIQA8nPjgS_blog.html).Â  This is a pretty classy guy doing some actual good, hard to not get a little misty reading it.Â  Nice job.
