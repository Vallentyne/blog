Several things about [this article ](http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/chickens-four-times-bigger-than-they-used-to-be-study-1.2041561?hootPostID=ba983f0a545dfb1e32eb627021fae7be)jumped out at me as I read it.

First off, it seems that we are doing a FANTASTIC job of breeding chickens in the last 50 years or more.Â  How good are we at breeding chickens you may ask?Â  Let me tell you.Â  It seems that overall the size of a chicken today is 4 times that of a chicken in the 1950s.Â  For some perspective, this meansÂ that we are probably going to manage to breed a chicken large enough to feed a whole street, followed immediately by creating a chicken large enough toÂ kill many streets of peaceful humans, all of which could happenÂ within my lifetime.

This is all very reminiscent of a Patton Oswalt bit, in which he eerily predicted this very outcome.Â  I give you:Â  MEGALEG

The second thing that I noticed about this article is the fact that there is aÂ [NationalÂ Chicken Council](http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/), which fortunately (or rather unsurprisingly)Â exists in the US.Â  It had not occurred to me that this would be a necessary organization, but then again with the inevitable Rise of the Chickens (tm), it would probably make good sense to keepÂ a close watch on these terrifying, but stillÂ tasty critters.
