This video is almost 9 minutes long, but there's no need to watch the whole thing.Â  Give it a start and notice the soccer player chatting confidently in his crisp grey shirt to the press.Â  It doesn't matter what he is saying, because then click ahead in the timeline to say, oh 2 minutes in and notice the sweat beginning to show through his shirt.Â  Then click again a couple more times, say 5 minutes and 7 minutes and ask yourself just how un-fricking-believably hot is it in that room?Â  His shirt completely dissolves into a rather disgusting mess.Â  Perhaps those three large hot coffees and bowl of spicy chili just before the press conference was a bad idea?Â  Wow, that's sweaty.Â  I have been that sweaty, but only WHILE RUNNING 10KM.Â  Yikes.
