Not hard to tell I'm on the summer blogging schedule....

Don't think I've abandoned you however, especially the Korean blog scraper guys that have been sucking content from my site for weeks now.  I love you guys too, or whatever software you use to do the sucking.  The jokes on you guys, when I don't even post for days on end nowadays.  Boy do I ever love sticking it to the spam blog guys... except they probably don't care.

Ah good times.

Anyway, here's a couple of interesting products I thought were kind of neat.

First off, here's a [very funny blog post](http://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/2007/06/24/froot-loops-cereal-straws/) about a product we definitely don't need:  Froot Loops in the shape of a straw.  Basically, the idea is to just drink milk through this thing and you've got milk that tastes like the liquid sugar sludge at the bottom of your cereal bowl that is the pure liquid form of diabetes.  What this blogger misses though, is what this product is really for.  It's not a straw really, but think of it instead as Froot Loop loaf, like bulk Froot Loop for hardcore 'Loopers.  It's like when you buy a whole side of beef so you can cut your own steaks, this is what cereal fanatics would go nuts for.  Now you can utterly control how much Loop surface area there is touching the milk at any one time.  Maybe you feel a bit tougher than usual?  Cut those Loops thick and juicy...  Cereal perfection.

Moving on to better things, here's the ultimate accessory for the road warrior: [The Roadbag](http://www.roadbag.de/index.php).  Essentially a high tech trucker bomb, it's just a bag filled with a substance that soaks up urine into a gel, probably much like a diaper.  The site is in German, so I can't really figure out what they are saying, but there doesn't seem to be much for the ladies here.

Presumably for single use only (ick), they come at the indecipherable price of 12,00 â‚¬ for a Sorglospaket, which is wow, you know, pretty good.Â  Or something.

Thanks to Boing Boing and Neatorama for today's content, soon to be routed further to Korea I would imagine....
