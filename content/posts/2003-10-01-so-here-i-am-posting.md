So here I am posting a blog for the first time in FOREVER.  Nothing too new on my end except trying desperately to make drapes for the dining room window.  It's a very slow going process and it gets interrupted frequently.  But, whaddayagonnado?

On another note, Court is bugging the hell out of me regarding what is going on this weekend.  He is being very secret about the whole thing.  My curiosity is peaked.  I'm told to pack the boy for the weekend and that is it.  Hmmm.  I'm starting to wonder if he will be taking us to the Mohegan Sun Resort Casino in UNCASVILLE, CT.  As every year passes that we are together, I start to wonder how close the ties are between he and the Prince of Darkness, what with all the short plane jokes and such, y'know?  We are both bound to burn in hell.  Next thing you know, regular poker nights will be with real money after all.  I guess this means this Friday's regular poker night is canceled.

Well I've written enough for one post, it is time to go now and cater to the boy's needs, like LUNCH!  If I can avoid looking at "The Toe" I may still have an appetite to eat with him.  Honestly, that thing is gross looking.  I'm so glad he had a cast on for two weeks.
