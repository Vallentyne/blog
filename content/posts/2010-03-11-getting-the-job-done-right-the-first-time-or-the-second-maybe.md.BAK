Nikki and I have been doing some painting around the house lately, and thinking of some other small renovations in the near future. It's the small things you do that make the difference in your house, I think.

[This Old House](http://www.thisoldhouse.com) has long been a great source of "Home Inspection Nightmares" where there are 19 ["Nightmare" galleries](http://search.thisoldhouse.com/search.html?Ntt=home+inspection+nightmares&bu=&x=0&y=0) and counting.Â  Some of them are incredible, most are scary, but usually just hilarious.

First we have the most convenient shower anywhere:

A window, electrical outlet, AND the toilet paper all inside the shower!Â  Well done, sir.

These steel support beams are just for looks, anyway.

That PVC pipe will probably take the load, sure.
