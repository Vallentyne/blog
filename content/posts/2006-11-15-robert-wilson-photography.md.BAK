I have been a little tardy with the updates lately, so I missed the official re-launch of the Robert Wilson Photography website.  I'm not a pro blogger, ok?  That should be perfectly obvious by now.  Anyway, head on over and take a gander at [Wilson's new site](http://www.robertwilsonphoto.com/).  Besides showing off more pictures, which is really the point of a photography website, some of the features I love the best:





	      * No splash page with that system detection stuff.
	      * No stealing my browser window.
	      * No Flash (I think my constant griping was probably a small push in this direction for Wilson)
	      * Best of all, lots of personalization and a human aspect that was missing from the last site.  There's some personal philosophy stuff, and obviously something dear to my heart, the site includes a new photography blog a la Wilson.  Now that's how you connect with your customers, you look involved, engaged, and approachable.  Bravo, Wilson.



My other [gripe](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/01/03/wilson-dont-look-at-this/) that didn't completely get addressed is the easy way to link to a picture bit that was completely missing from the last site.Â  You can still get the URL for an [image](http://www.robertwilsonphoto.com/portraits12SM.jpg) on the new site by right-clicking, which is good, but the links don't look permanent.Â  That's not too terrible as long as they stay addressable for as long as they are for sale I guess.
Now off you go, click on his site and explore the crannies and admire the clean looks.
