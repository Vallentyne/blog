I try to do my part for the environment, certainly not as much as some, but I would say I'm conscious of my presence here on earth and it's impact.

Anyway,Â  I was just scanning [this article](http://www.slate.com/id/2164073/fr/rss/) on green transportation ideas when I saw the following:

Holy Crap Batman!Â  What the hell is going on here?Â  One hundred years of automotive research, and that's what the average consumption is at?Â  Forget environmental conspiracy theories, that's just terrible science.Â  It's embarassing even.Â  What the hell is going on here?Â  It's inconceivable that this hasn't improved across the board since then, let alone get worse.

Well that's your depressing thought for the day.
