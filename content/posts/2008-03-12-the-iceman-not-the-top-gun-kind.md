I saw a link on Neatorama the other day that I thought was especially appropriate for Nikki ([who is always cold](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/02/15/thermal-thief/), no matter what the temperature is).  It's about a guy who can apparently [withstand cold](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4393377&page=1) that would kill anyone else, and we aren't talking about a little cold here, we are talking about chest deep in ice-water for over an hour with nothing on.  He climbed Mount Everest dressed in a pair of shorts.  That's it.  Crap.  He is a living, breathing super-hero, really.  This guy is hard core, I can't imagine how he does it.  The scientists are practially speechless:


<blockquote>

But no one has come close to climbing Everest in those kinds of conditions," Dr. Kamler said. "It's â€¦ it's almost inconceivable."</blockquote>

It's a good read, I recommend you check it out.  Imagine the money I could save on winter clothing and heating the house if I could figure out how to do that.....  You wouldn't need clothes at all, actually.  Well, maybe just for social reasons.  He may be the Iceman, but I bet there's no amount of willpower that can stop shrinkage.
