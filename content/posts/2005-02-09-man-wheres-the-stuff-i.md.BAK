Man, where's the stuff?  I am on a very infrequent posting binge lately, sorry to those of you who actually visit this site.  Thanks Mom.

Work is hopping enough to keep me completely off the content train.  It's not like there aren't things happening that I need to talk about, I just have no friggin time lately.

So, what's been happening?  Well, the family is just dandy.  Jordy is in the choir at her school and they got drafted up to the big league.  Apparently the high school in town is putting on a production of Annie and they realized they were short a bunch of dirty singing orphans.  So they called Jordy's school, and she's in.

I'm not sure just how I should be taking that, but when I realized that Nikki had to make her a costume, I started to feel a bit better about it.  I mean, if they said she didn't need a costume, then I would have a problem with things.  Anyway, her dress rehearsal is tonight so we can she just how she does as a dirty orphan dressed in brand-new tailored rags.

Quinn is still something of a mystery.  If you had to imagine what living with him is like, try picturing this:  You're blindfolded, you're playing badminton alone with 6 mimes but instead of a birdie it's a grenade, and bees are stinging you everywhere.  The translation is this:  It's exhilarating and usually painful, but also unpredictable, and sometimes somebody dies.  If we haven't seen you lately, just count your blessings, and we will surface sometime after Quinn turns 4.

The big man is still the big man, Cael is progressing into the babbling stage.  Overall he knows maybe 10 words that are only discernible by Nikki and I.  He still loves his food, especially bacon grease served "a la poubelle".  Ask Nikki about that one, it's a new dish.  He is still crawling, no real walking efforts yet, for which we are extremely grateful.

Finally, Nikki and I had a small vacation this weekend in Toronto, thanks to the efforts of Paul and Darlene, bless them.  We had a great time, went to see Mama Mia and loved the show.  It was a really good way to recharge the batteries.  Also we went with our friends Anne-Marie and Andre who are nuts but great fun.  They even put up with our layabout behaviour on Saturday with good grace and nary a complaint (not only did we sleep in and didn't get out to breakfast until 10:30, we came home immediately and had a nap until 4:00, it's pretty ridiculous).  We made up for it somewhat at night, and managed a couple of late evenings, card playing and such.

Anyway, it's all good.
