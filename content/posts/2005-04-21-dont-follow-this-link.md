Whatever you do, don't click lightly today.  If you remember the little post about medicinal maggots [I wrote about](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/09/this_is_the_mos.html) a while back, well here's a much more detailed look at it, in every sense of the word.  It's an account of [a person's experience with this treatment](http://www.livescience.com/humanbiology/050419_maggots.html), with pictures.  It's a real gut check, looking at those pictures.

Still amazing medicine though.  I'm not sure what I would do if I had to have it myself.  I mean, that's the friggin definition of "my skin is crawling".

Now I have a case of the willies that probably won't go away all day.
