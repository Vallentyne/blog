I don't think you have to be a huge nerd to find this funny, but it helps.  [Chad Vader](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CiW838wNiM) is the manager at a supermarket, he doesn't get the respect he thinks he deserves.

This is quite good, and [part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC29Nhc_kes) is also entertaining.

For one thing, get a listen to the guitar strumming the Star Wars bad guy theme, that's one of the better parts to be sure.
