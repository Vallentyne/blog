Still more evidence that things are turning against us.  

[Disturbing report](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8122-826557_1,00.html) that a parasite carried by the common house cat infects us and changes our behaviour.  When men are affected they become scruffy, disagreeable, suspicious, prone to fighting and jealous.  When women are affected they "spent more money on clothes and were consistently rated as more attractive. ...found they were more easy-going, more warm-hearted, had more friends and cared more about how they looked."

Interesting little effects there, eh?  The women become more outgoing and attractive while the men become more likely to fight over them.  It sounds like a perfect little combination to have us take each other out fighting over our women, don't you think?

Well, as if you needed another reason to hate cats, that's the best one so far.
