I'm a reasonable person. I don't suffer from racism or intolerance. I'm rather proud of our melting-pot culture, and I'm all for religious freedom. But the Supreme Courts decision in this case is unfathomable, and beyond irresponsible.

At what point does religious freedom outweigh public safety? I don't care if the kirpan is a religious symbol. It is a weapon pure and simple. I don't care if there haven't been any documented cases of kirpans being used as weapons. I'm sure there were no documented cases of box cutters being used as weapons either prior to 9/11. Humans are humans. Humans lose their temper; Humans lose control; Humans often seek vengeance for a perceived wrong. It happens every day. Violence happens despite handy statistics suggesting a specific scenario has never happened before. There always will be a first time. I guarantee it.

I'm not even talking about the average Sikh student carrying a kirpan going off the deep end and using it as a weapon; Although that could happen too. I'm talking about a regular confrontation that happens all the time in schools being taken too far because the presence of the innocent kirpan exacerbated the situation. Because, let me tell you, to everyone else the kirpan is a weapon no matter what Sikhs call it. And what about the local school bullies who target the Sikh student because he's wearing the dagger? What happens when they take it away from him and injure him, or even kill him with his own religious symbol? Do you think the honorable Supreme Court justices will take any responsibility when that happens?

No, me neither.

Some people argue that kids are allowed to bring baseball bats to school. Baseball bats can be used as a weapon, can't they? Well, I don't know about the rest of the country, but kids are NOT allowed to bring baseball bats to school anymore in my area of Ottawa, for the precise reasons I've laid out above. Personally, I think that is excessive. And for those who think that's hypocritical of me; let me ask you this. What do you think of first when you see a baseball bat? That's right. Baseball. A sport. Now, what do you think of first when you see a dagger? I bet for most non-Sikhs it's not religion.

When it comes down to it, anything can be used as a weapon. The point is kirpans will now single out Sikhs. It will make them the targets of bullies, and those that are poisoned with intolerance. Should it be that way? Of course not. Will it be that way? I'm afraid so. We don't live in a Utopian society. We have to face reality.

Our laws forgive kids of the worst crimes imaginable because they are not deemed to be fully in control of themselves. They are still maturing or something like that. Given that, what makes these judges, or any proponent of this ruling for that matter, think that allowing these kids who are immature, and not fully in control of themselves to carry daggers is a good idea? How is it that the judges claim that this allowance is somehow defending the foundation that our constitution was built on?

I often wonder at what point are these learned judges responsible for the consequences of their half-baked decisions? Learned they may be. Wise? Apparently not.
