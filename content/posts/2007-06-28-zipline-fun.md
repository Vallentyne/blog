Having recently been on a fun zipline day, [this link](http://www.influks.com/post1350.html) caught my eye.Â  That is one scary, and fun ride.Â  The statistics speak for themselves:

_Height: 918 ft / 280 m
Length: 1.2 miles / 2 km
Top speed: 100 mph / 160 kmph_

On the much saner side of things, [Lafleche Adventures](http://www.aventurelafleche.ca/en/parc.php?lang=fr) is a lot of fun, I "highly" recommend it.Â  Oh, that's soo funny.

I saw the first link on Neatorama.
