To say that this clip has some action in it might be an understatement.

It makes the Matrix look like a documentary about a chess game. Â What the heck is going on in this movie? Â It's ridiculous, campy, awesome, original and silly at the same time. Â It makes me want to see the whole movie, but I have a sneaky suspicion we all just saw the best parts. Â It perfectly tweaks all of my moronic male action movie triggers.

I will make a prediction that Nikki will not watch the whole clip to the end. Â I would imagine most guys will watch to the end, because we are wired to like stupid crap like this. Â Every once I a while the stupid rises up in me and I am biologically compelled to watch a movie like this. Â I will declare this fact, and Nikki pretends to watch it with me in a show of solidarity, but in reality will be asleep before the first 10 guys are killed. Â She's a lightweight when it comes to mindless violence, although she does have a soft spot for superhero movies. Â I wonder if it has anything to do with the rippling muscles and spandex? Â Huh.

Damn you Hugh Jackman. Â Damn you and my simple-minded addiction to slow motion explosions.
