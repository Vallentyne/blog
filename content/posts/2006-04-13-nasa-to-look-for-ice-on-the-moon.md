I caught this [nerdy news a few days ago](http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/04/10/moon.mission.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories) about NASA's plans to smash the moon with a probe in hopes of excavating a large area at once.  The idea is to create a big cloud of dust, which will hopefully contain water vapour or ice that they can detect.  Pretty impressive project, although not the first of it's kind, it is pretty cheap on the scale of these things; $80 million.

Anyway, that's really a pretty neat project, but also completely useless.  Useless, I say.  There is no need to search for ice on the moon at all when ice is already [raining down on the earth](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1826352) as we speak.  Yes, apparently a large chunk of ice fell out of the sky in California and buried itself into an empty lot near Oakland.  Strangely, no-one can be sure where it came from, and nobody seems to be interested in looking into it further.  Can you say "secret government relations with aliens cover-up so that no-one will find out all of our elected officials are really aliens that eat oil?"  I can.  I won't of course, but I could.
