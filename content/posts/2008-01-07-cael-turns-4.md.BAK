A big Happy Birthday to Cael today.Â  It's hard to believe that our littlest guy isn't so little anymore.Â  It looks like he may have celebrated a little early last night however, since he is rather under the weather today.Â  Poor fella.

Â Anyway, he is becoming quite the little man, and his personality has definitely emerged this year as a clown capable of keeping us in stitches.

Happy Birthday buddy.
