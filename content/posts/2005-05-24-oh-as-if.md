Apparently, if you believe this stuff, scientists have located the so-called centre of the brain that controls sarcasm.  This quote says it all, as far as I'm concerned:


<blockquote>"some brain-damaged people can't comprehend sarcasm"</blockquote>

Amen, brother.  I mean there's just nothing more frustrating talking to someone who doesn't get it.  For me it's like a language barrier.

Anyway, neat stuff.
