Alright, Alright, I'm here now.  Congratulations Andrea and John - when they're about a year and a half old, you can race'em(the twins, not Andrea and John).




Don't really have much to say other than that words, "prenatal", "parental" and "paternal" are all anagrams for each other.




I really have too much time on my hands still.  My latest thought is "why the future is not as vivid as the past?"  We have perfect perception of the present, slightly hazy recollections of the past but nothing but intuition for the future (unless you're "psychic").  Why is that?  I think we should be given the same vision of the future as the past - it is the same distance away chronologically, right?




Anyone with insight or a solution to this, please advise and bring lottery numbers.




Later Dudes.
