Who wouldn't be surprised by a nut-cracking gorilla?  It's a nightmarish scenario, really.

That title alone is all you really need to see, the [actual article](http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/10/18/nutcracking.gorillas.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories) isn't nearly as funny as the title.  Before you ask, yes I'm incredibly juvenile.  But really, that's a mental image you don't need to be 6 years old to appreciate.

Anyway, once you get over the giggles, the article is a neat look at how these gorillas are using tools in ways that were once thought to be impossible.
