I don't know what happened, but "Dick Rizzo's Chippendale Dance Academy(tm)" was closed when I showed up.  Something about Revenue Canada, and the police.

Huh, oh well.

What else is happening?  Not much, just the normal stuff I suppose.  Cael is over 18lbs.  Jordy is beautiful.  Quinn is neither beautiful or 18lbs.  Nikki is beautiful and very very patient with me.  Let me explain.

I signed us up for [ZIP.ca](http://www.zip.ca), which I highly recommend to anyone.  The Globe and Mail [did a piece](http://globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040219/ZIP19//?query=zip.ca) on it recently, since it just opened for business in February.  It's a local company started in Ottawa, which is way cool.  The deal is simple, sign up, choose some DVD movies on the web site and they will start mailing them to you, you can have 3 movies at a time for as long as you like.  Then when you're done send one or all of them back and they will mail you the next one in your queue.  No late fees, no shipping charges.  And it's $25/month.  For some, that's outrageous.  For me, that's a savings of approximately $700-800 per month on late charges.  Approximately.  It's a ballpark figure.  Give or take.

So anyway, give it a try.  Any Canadian resident can sign up.  If you get mail, you can get movies.  They offer a 2 week free trial so have at it.

I usually don't like to offer advertising space for companies for free on the blog or anywhere, but really this is a sound business plan, well executed, and it's likely to save me lots of money.  Why not?  The vast audience of Vallentyne.com lending it's financial muscle to this company is quite a boost to a struggling startup I would think.
