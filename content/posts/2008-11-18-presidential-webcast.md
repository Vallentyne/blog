Remember how I worried that in order to lead today you should really be able to [embrace technology](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/07/16/breaking-news-old-fart-too-old-to-be-president/)? Â I also worried that the old guy was actually a [clue-less dinosaur](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/07/22/mccain-is-now-6-days-older-than-the-last-time-i-said-he-was-too-old/)? Â Anyway, it seems that my worry was needless, since McCain really should have given that old Internet thing a closer look.

There is a lot of proof that [Obama's use of the Internet](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/10/obamas-secret-w.html) has not only been [a crucial piece of his victory](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/11/propelled-by-in.html), but has [forever changed American politics](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet-campaign-changed-politics/). Â Didn't hurt that he recruited one of the co-founders of Facebook to help, I suppose.

It's going to be fun and awesome and probably very rocky for a while until everybody figures this stuff out.


<blockquote>â€œThere will be a lot of collateral damage coming to grips with the fact that weâ€™re in a reality TV series, â€˜Politics 24/7,â€™â€ Mr. Newsom said.

Thatâ€™s a good thing, Mr. Trippi said. â€œThis medium demands authenticity, and television for the most part demanded fake. Authenticity is something politicians havenâ€™t been used to.â€</blockquote>


Even something as simple as a weekly radio address is (somehow just now) [being taped for YouTube and Internet consumption](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081114.wgtobama1114/BNStory/Technology/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081114.wgtobama1114). Â Brilliant. Â If he can really pull off this kind of connectedness and grass-roots organization it just might be the start of something better than I expected.

Now we just need to get Stephen Harper to wake up and smell the coffee.
