Here's a neat blog post, about some of the more impressive trees around the world.Â  Very neat stuff, trees certainly are one of the better things about nature.Â  I learned a few things for sure. Who knew they got so frigging big?Â  Man.

Not that it's hard to do, but nature is a good thing, we should appreciate it more.
