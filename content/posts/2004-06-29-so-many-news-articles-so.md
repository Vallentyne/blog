So many news articles, so little time.

First off, I must say that I only I had known that [mobile phones kill off sperm](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/28/mobile_ball_rot/) it would have saved a lot of trouble recently.  Just sew a couple of Motorolas into your gitch and you're golden.  But no, I have to go and actually have "surgery" to get the same effect.  Jeez.

Also, I may not have said it loudly enough before, but it would be better for all of us if you switched to [another](http://www.mozilla.org) [browser](http://www.opera.com).  There are more and more real nasty problems with Internet Explorer that make it really scary to be browsing the Internet with your pants down like that.  Try the alternatives, they have features especially tabbed browsing that kick IE's pants.

That's all for now.
