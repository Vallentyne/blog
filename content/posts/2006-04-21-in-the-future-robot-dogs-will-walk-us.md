A robotics company is showing off it's [prototype of a military dog](http://www.livescience.com/technology/060409_robot_sherpa.html) that will accompany soldiers into the field, carrying gear and trotting alongside the soldiers.  It's an incredible thing, really.  The article includes a link to a video of the thing that is cool, but borders on creepy (the file is also huge, so be warned).  For one, they give the thing a hard kick sideways and it quickly recovers and keeps on moving, which is really cool and a mean feat of engineering.  The problem I have with it is the gait with which it moves.  It's stiff and mechanical, of course, but there's a certain quality about it trotting around with those black socks on that really gives me the chills.  They look like an old man's legs....
