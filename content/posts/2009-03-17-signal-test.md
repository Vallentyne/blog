There have been no blog posts here.Â  I blame work for being just too work-y.Â  No apologies, just more of a transmission test.

In keeping with [my last post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/03/13/dwarfed-punk/) about what the Internet is for, it most definitely is for pictures of cats.Â  I don't know why, it just is, even if I don't really subscribe to that myself.

Here is [Satan's cat](http://www.wmur.com/family/18814224/detail.html), if he ever had one.Â  Be sure to check out the slideshow and video there, that's one butt-ugly cat.

Alternatively, [this rat](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1153931/On-rat-walk-Rodent-strikes-pose-budding-fashion-photographer.html) is Pixar-cute and if you spend enough time on the Internet you know that's how things work.Â  That's what the Internet can do, it can find you a rat that is 10x cuter than a given cat.

That will be all for today.Â  Real blog posts will resume at some point I assure you, dear reader.
