Let me say without doubt that you will never forget seeing this video. Â It's called Mallakhamb, and it's Indian pole gymnastics, and it also makes regular gymnastics look like a slumber party. Â No man can watch this without cringing. Â Wired has the [goods](http://www.wired.com/playbook/2010/08/mallakhamb-extreme-gymnastics/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+wired/index+(Wired:+Index+3+(Top+Stories+2))).

Cripes, that looks painful. Â Painfully impressive.
