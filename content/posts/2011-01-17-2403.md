Â 

Due to a cosmic coincidence entirely out of my control, both boys were in nets this weekend for separate practices.Â  Quinn enjoyed his time, but decided that he is done in nets for this year, a decision that makes me secretly happy.Â  Cael did really well, and was able to move around better than any other of his teammates, probably because the shared goalie equipment fit him much better than some of the other kids on the team.Â  You [might remember the other kids](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2010/11/19/kids-hockey-update/) on Cael's team?Â  Yep.

Anyway, there you go.Â  I have a short video that I will put up a little later on, I think it goes a long way toward demonstrating the blistering speed at which this beautiful game is played.
