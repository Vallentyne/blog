Talk about aiming nice and low for your kids, this is the perfect gift for that special little budding thug.Â  This way they can model and test out that full-face skull tattoo before they actually get the ink done on their 15th birthday.Â  You can probably combine this with a very special talk about visible "identifying marks" and the art of police lineup evasion.Â  It's all about the demographic, is it?
