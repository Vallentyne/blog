Alrighty, this will be the last of the [Street](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/05/sesame_street_n.html) [series](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/05/sesame_street_n_1.html), since you can just go and search YouTube for yourself to find tons of other clips to your own liking.  It's really rather silly of me to just post links and call it entertaining content.  (oh wait, that's all this blog _is_ actually, a regurgitation of other content with the bare minimum of my own words to frame and present the work of others.  Dang.  Pretend you don't notice, and I'll pretend to be funny.)

The [Capital I](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InFRdJGHFk) song is something I still find myself humming 25 years later.  I swear this song makes it's way into your brain and sets up camp there, you just can't get rid of it.  Similarly, [The Ladybug's Picnic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr8vUTm64h0) is a catchy song I find myself playing on the guitar to this day.

And of course [Grover the waiter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GOGNE0nWHk), tons of these on YouTube, all very very funny.

This concludes my lookback at Sesame Street, it's been brought to you by the letter W, etc.
