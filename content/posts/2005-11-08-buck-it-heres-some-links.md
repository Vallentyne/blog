Ok, this was breaking news when I first put it all together, but now it's a bit stale because of my day job responsibilities.  Oh well.

It was an interesting week (last week) if you were a deer.  First off, the authorities [noticed](http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/04/news/newsmakers/deer/index.htm?section=cnn_topstories) that a lot of your deerly departed brothers were from Pennsylvania, so you can sort of infer that deer in Pennsylvania are more depressed, or maybe oppressed, than anywhere else in the US.  Then, another deer got a little desperate in Arkansas and [picked the wrong home to break into](http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGBE7Y1XJFE.html).  The man who lived there got downright crazy on that deer and definitely took out the trash.  Wow.

So, noticing this recent upswing in deer drama, TV producers, er, researchers at the University of Missouri have decided to capitalize on this and start a deer-related reality TV show, called [American Idoel](http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/04/news/newsmakers/deer/index.htm?section=cnn_topstories).  It will feature all sorts of bad deer activity, a la Cops.  The best part is, they've hired deer to shoot the series also, as part of their equal opportunity program.
