A very cool article on Wired today about a company that specializes in [underwater logging](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.02/logs.html?pg=1&topic=logs&topic_set=).  Apparently there are significant forests (estimated to be $50 billion worldwide) that are currently underwater due to hydro dam projects.  Anyway, the story goes into how the actual logging process is basically the only guilt-free logging in the world since there is no habitat problem, no greenhouse problem, and not even any noise produced.  It's a brilliant idea, really and this guy deserves the heaps of money he is undoubtedly going to make.  The process is nice and geeky too, with an underwater, chainsaw wielding-remote controlled robot.  The pilot guides the robot to the tree, staples large floaties to the logs and then cuts them down with an 8 foot chainsaw.  So cool, and environmentally friendly.

I can still remember getting completely creeped out by the huge amount of fallen logs visible at the bottom of Clayton Lake as a kid.Â  It was a tangled mess of logs fallen every which way, and it seemed to be just waiting to trap a swimmer's foot.Â  Or at least to my 14 year old self.Â  This company doesn't bother with logs that can be seen from the surface, but rather with still standing trees in over 150 feet of water.
