I'm a little tired today, Nikki and I stayed up and had dinner after the kids were in bed.  It was very nice, actually, I made Yakatori steak and chicken, had a couple of beers, all good.
I digress, since I'm not one to kiss and tell.  I just wanted to say that I'm tired today (and here's the segue) but I'm probably not as tired as [this lady](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4142183.stm), however.  Apparently she has some sort of brain condition that requires an implant to stimulate her brain to function normally.  The doctors were kind enough to give her a remote so she could shut the thing off and get some sleep (the first version wasn't a wireless remote, it was rather more inconvenient).  All well and good, except that the remote got stolen with her purse and now she can't sleep.  The article goes on to describe the remote with "four grey buttons and two blue buttons on it" and mentions that the police are asking for it's return since it's useless to anybody else.  True.

As for myself....I'm wondering what the heck the other buttons are for.  How well did she know the surgeon?  Anybody seen the Stepford Wives?  (I know only 4 people saw that movie, but it wasn't completely bad and it is relevant here)  What if one of the other buttons has a completely different effect?  Like, oh I don't know, KILL BARNEY THE DINOSAUR!  That would be something, wouldn't it?  Lots of people hate Barney, maybe this surgeon did too.

Not me of course, I love Barney.

But just think of the possiblities, it's right out of a James Bond movie, an army of zombies, doing the evil villain's bidding by remote control.

Anyway, that's a bit of a tangent there for you.
