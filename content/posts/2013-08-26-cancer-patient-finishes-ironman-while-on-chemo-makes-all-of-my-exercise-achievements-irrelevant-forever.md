So, in case you needed a hard objective look at just how few excuses there really are in life, allow me to present this kickass girl:



	  * She had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January and half of her pancreas, stomach and gallbladder had to be removed. Statistics gave her only a 10-per-cent chance to live five more years.
	  * just finished a round of chemo in January, going in for another one in September
	  * (this one is just for me) is 50 years old, mother of two

Aaand then she proceeded to finish an Ironman triathlon on Sunday.Â  Not even her first Ironman, mind you.

So, it seems that she has earned the long sought after title of "Stupendous Badass".Â  In other news, I have wasted my life and am currently handing over any integrity/honour/courage I may have thought I had.Â  Jebus, people.Â  That's a tough cookie, I tip my hat to her.
