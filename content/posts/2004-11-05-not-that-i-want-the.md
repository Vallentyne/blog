Not that I want the blog to become political at all, but I found this stuff pretty funny.  Apparently since Bush won the Canadian Immigration website has been swamped with traffic from the States.  Here's [an article on CNET](http://news.com.com/2061-1028-5439470.html?tag=rsspr.5439471) about it.  The article also covers some of the more humourous websites that offer advice one way or another.  Here's a good ["review" of Canada](http://www.bushwatch.com/canada.htm) on an anti-Bush website:

<blockquote>**If you'd like to visit France but would rather not subject yourself to the verbal abuse from its citizens, consider visiting Quebec Province, home of Montreal, the second largest French-speaking city in the world. The courtesy of its citizens toward visitors mumbling in ungrammatical Gallic exemplifies the motto of the Province: "We're France On Training Wheels !**</blockquote>


That's friggin gold, baby!  Given the [recent Canadian Flag business](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/RemembranceDay/2004/11/04/700644-cp.html), this seems even more on the mark than normal.

Whew, that's a lot of politics in one post.  I'm spent.
