$1465.50 is the estimate. I knew it. "Damage under a thousand" my arse. At least this way I know I'm going through insurance, and buddy at the collision center said that even though my insurance has to pay for it, it will be her rates that go up (based on the accident report, which I now have to get the cop to write up).
