HP is applying for a patent that calls for a digital camera to have circuits that would allow the **subjects **in a photograph to digitally blur their own faces with the click of a remote.  This is a sort of anti-paparazzi move, I guess.  I think this is more or less really stupid.  First of all, the second they ship one of these cameras, all of their competitors immediately have an advantage, since their gear doesn't have remotely controlled "screw up your picture" stuff.  I mean, who would buy a camera like that?  Then, of course take into account the millions of cameras that currently exist that won't blur faces on demand.  Also, I would assume that the remote control to turn on the blur-cuitry would probably cost money.  And again, who the hell would buy it?  I'm sure that the paparazzi are just lining up to snap up these things.




Here's the baffling link
