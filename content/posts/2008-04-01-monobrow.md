You may be familiar with the unibrow, but that is now a socially unacceptable moniker.Â  In fact the winds of change are in the air, there is a site that not only educates, but rather celebrates the monobrow, and brings monobros and mono (-chicks? -ladies? -sistas?) together.

Behold [Monobrow.com](http://Monobrow.com), Celebrating the Unity of Your Eyebrows.

Try not to look surprised all of the time (which is a common problem for the monobrow-blessed) at the monobro of the week pics.Â  Truly inspiring.
