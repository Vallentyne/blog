HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU,
I KNOW IT'S ALREADY TWO.
IT'S MY 1st CHANCE POST,
AND I FAILED TO BEAT YOU.

Well, my plans on posting before my hubby did today have been foiled by two of the smaller men in the family.

Anyway, I just wanted to say that Court turns 30-something today and he looks like he's still in his twenties.  Well done my dear.  Lucky you, lucky me.

Happy Birthday honey, I hope work is treating you well, and I will look forward to celebrating with you over a nice dinner tonight with Kent and the family.

Love you Baby!
