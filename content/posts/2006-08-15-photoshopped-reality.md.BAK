CNET has a [gallery of pictures](http://news.com.com/2300-1026_3-6033210-1.html?tag=ne.gall.pg) up that serve as a reminder that our news is always filtered, scrubbed, embellished, buffed and sweetened. It's a whole series of pictures that have appeared in the media and news that have since been proven to be altered. This provides some nice depth to the [recent story](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/1,7340,L-3286966,...) about a Reuters photographer who (very poorly) added some touches to a picture he took. In this case the end result is almost laughable once you notice the problem.

So, as usual, the moral of the story is: If you are going to lie, be sure you don't suck at lying.
