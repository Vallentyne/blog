What's this?  An ever so slight lightening of the gloom?  A slight stirring of the soul?  No.

But wait, yes, there's something there.

I think I can almost see the end of this two-month spell of working like crazy people to get ready for Christmas.  Almost.  Nikki's task list is suddenly only two pages long, 6 point, double-sided, instead of 10 pages long.  I'm getting ready to do some real painting in the basement (unlike the fake painting I have been doing so far), the Christmas decorations are done, Jordy's room is almost done to Nikki's standards, Christmas shopping is winding down (mostly cause we're broke), you get the idea.

I must say that I will be looking forward to this Christmas season more than usual because of the pace of the last two months.

Hope to have a beer with some of you at the Christmas party as well.  So far 85 invited guests said "yes" to the invitation.  Murdoch has a lot to do with that little number, tho.  Murdoch, d-e-d.

Later.
