There isn't a human alive that won't feel better about themselves after hearing the tale of these two knuckleheads.


<blockquote>Let's go rob a house!

Cool!Â  But we don't have masks...

No worries, we will disguise ourselves with this Sharpie marker.

Awesome!Â  I want to be Catwoman!

What? Um, ok.Â  I think I will just colour my whole face in, except my nose, cause that would look sooo stupid if I coloured my nose...

Yeah!</blockquote>

The best part of their disguise isn't that it does nothing to conceal their identities of course, but rather the fact that they didn't can't take it off afterwards (assuming it occurred to them that they should take it off), and hilarity ensued.Â  I bet the cop who stopped them had to call for backup, he probably couldn't see from the tears of laughter.

So, thank you, young morons.Â  My step is a little more sprightly, my back is straighter, and my outlook is refreshed.Â  No matter what I do today, I'm pretty fairly _extremely_ confident that it will turn out better than this.

Thanks to [Boing Boing](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/3fowjxX1Ln0/robbers-wearing-mark.html) and [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2009/10/30/the-worst-disguise-ever-the-permanent-marker-disguise/) for bringing this to my attention, and I stole the Catwoman joke, too.Â  I don't even feel bad about it, because of the lift these two retards brought to my day.

CNN has the [original story](http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/29/iowa.marker.disguise/index.html).
