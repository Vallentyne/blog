Alright, so [the track](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wilsons_suburban_funkadelic_dream.mp3) that Robbie and I (poured our heart and soul into by the way) released into the wild wasn't very good.  I'm willing to admit that.  It could have been the auditory beer goggles we had on that night clouding our usually discerning musical sensibilites.

But all that mediocrity aside, not one comment on how bad the song was from any of you cowards?  I mean once we finished it we played it for the [Cynik Sisters](http://www.cynik.ca) and they said they loved it, although that was probably one of those pat-on-the-head, path-of-least-resistance things.  It probably seemed like a good idea to tell us it was great than to provoke the ires of tipsy amateur musicians.  But the rest of you, even filtered through the relative comfortable anonymity of a comment on the blog, didn't even bat an eye.

Maybe it was too pedestrain and conformed too well to provoke a reaction.  Well, just you wait, our next project is much edgier and sure to get you people talking.  Our new sound is more "beating a cat with bagpipes while clog-dancing on bubblewrap".  You're going to love it.
