Hey everybody!
I don't often get time in the office to contribute to Mundane Ramblings, however since "Operation Big Bed" became a total flop, as well as the "one nap a day" plan, I seem to have about a 1/2 hour a day to do something for me.  Quinn is back onto two naps a day, and in the play pen, so who am I to fight that?  I'd have to be an idiot.  Although, after this weekend, a few drinks, and some time spent in the neighbour's hot tub, some may say "too late".

So today marks the day of our 3rd year wedding anniversary.  For those of you who shared in that day with us, I wonder if you find it is as hard to believe it was that long ago as we do.  Seems like just yesterday to me, but two pregnancies, and two boys since that day are living proof that such time has passed.  Fortunately, I don't feel any older.  Unfortunately, I don't think I've matured any either.  So the third anniversary is leather.  Huh.  Leather, you say?  I'm sure the employees of Danier are thinking in terms of coats, gloves, shoes, etc.  What do you suppose the employees of the "Adult Shops" think in terms of?  Food for thought.  Personally, I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for a pair of shoes, or a leather bookmark.

Onto other topics, like the kids (big shocker there), Jordy had a bit of an epiphany last night.  She lost yet another tooth.  I'm sure you can guess where this is going.  She started asking questions like, "What is the tooth fairy's name?" She also said, "I can't decide if the tooth fairy is real, or if it is the parents that are giving the kids money."  Needless to say, the truth came out and Jordy was left with her jaw gaping.  No joke.  She is all excited to be in on the BIG SECRET that the grown-ups keep, and I find it really, really cute.  Looks like Santa and Peter Cottontail are still real though.  We'll keep you posted on them.  Problem is, she's not so good at keeping secrets.  We had a surprise birthday cake made for Kent last night, and the first thing she says when she comes through the door (in front of Kent) is, "So, did you have the cake yet?"  Good luck to those of you still trying to keep up the tooth fairy charade with Jordy around.

BTW:  Be sure to all wish Kent a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY on Friday wouldja!

I've been rambling for far too long, probably making up for lost time.  It's time to sign off for now.  See ya in a month or so when I get a chance to sign back on.

Later!
