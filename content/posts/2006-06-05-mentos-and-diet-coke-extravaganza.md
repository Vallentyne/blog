Talk about your home science experiments people.  I saw [a post](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/04/08/diet_coke_mentos_rap.html) on Boing Boing about this "scientific" oddity, which led this intrepid reporter to do some serious (ok about 20 seconds on Google) digging into this incredible phenomenon.  Here are the fruits of my labour:

[Slacker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9HTiXQaR_o) [kids](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QbNAtwWjZE) perform the experiment, not bad.

The best display though, [comes here](http://eepybird.com/dcm1.html).  These guys show some originality, and a budget.  Very nice.  

I had no idea that this benign combination of junk foods could be used for such hilarity.  I'm thinking that we need to try this at home....
