Here's a hint, never pick a fight when you are [out-gunned at the beginning](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-marine-uses-chain-saw-to-fend-off-attacking-mountain-lion/article1221908/).Â  It seems that a sick and hungry mountain lion picked the wrong ex-marine to munch on.Â  The bad news for the mountain lion was that the marine happened to be cutting firewood at the time.Â  He cut the beast on the shoulder and it ran off, later to be hunted down by park rangers.

As for the marine, this guy calmly went back to his pop-up trailer and spent the night in the bush with his family.Â  Hard core, I must say.Â  If I had to fight off a huge predator with a chainsaw I might be less inclined to spend the night myself, but I am not an ex-marine, clearly.

Now if you will excuse me, I have to go and wrestle the foil off the top of my yogurt container.
