(Very) Small sense of accomplishment here, this is the blog's 500th post.  If you look you can see that the archives go back to January 2003, which means that this thing has been around about 2 1/2 years.  That's a little less than a post every 2 days.  Which we all know is a crock of complete and utter crap since days and week go by sometimes without a single entry here. 

But, that's what you get when most of you still haven't sent in your subscription cheque to Mundane Ramblings.  For shame.
