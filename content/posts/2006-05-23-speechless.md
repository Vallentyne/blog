Some video today, I can't exactly describe it myself.  First, [a laughing Yogi](http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/KF/2006/05/laughing_yogi.mpeg), the audio echoes from this will stay with you for a long time to come.  I can't stop looking at his floppy hands from that clip.  Then, much more uncomfortably, [a monk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAhSSy4_7mc) who is really really really, um, **really **dedicated to his faith.  

Man, and they wonder why people don't go to church anymore.  Ok, that was a low blow, I really shouldn't kick them when they are down, etc.

I don't think there's much more I can say, or much more I should say, really.

This came from the [WFMU blog](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2006/05/laughing_yogi_c.html).  Apologies to (any one of the 6 of) you who might read this if this offends you.
