I'm an iPod guy as most of you know, it's an essential bus device now, I would probably pitch a huge, hairy fit if I had to ride the bus without it.  It's a soother for grownups.  Anyway, with the iPod comes using iTunes to manage the music, which of course absolutely rocks.  It really adds a whole new level of geeky when to listening to music; statistics.  Let me explain.

iTunes keeps track of the last time you played a song, and how many times you have ever played a song.  Combined with the simple 0-5 star rating system, this can give some interesting insights into your own musical tastes.  The song I have listened to the most is easily Sunshine So Fine by the Barsool Prophets, 17 plays.  In #2 is Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet with 14 plays.  Ok, that's not too weird yet.  What's most interesting is the third most often played song on the iPod: East Bound and Down by Jerry Reed, 12 plays.  Man, that's weird even by my tastes.  I had no idea I was playing that sucker to death like that.  I mean it's a good song, there's no better ditty to put on when you are running to catch the bus when you are late, it's a natural for chase music.  Anyway, so there you go.  I learned something about myself.  It's a personal  growth thing.
