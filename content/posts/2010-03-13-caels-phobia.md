Yesterday Cael and Nikki and I were driving in the van, and Cael announced that he has a phobia.Â  Keep in mind, he's 6, so we were pretty interested to hear what kind of self proclaimed phobia he could have.Â  He eloquently announced:

"I'm scared of things with sharp teeth that jump out at you."

I don't think that many of us would disagree with that one, buddy.Â  Least of all this guy, who was sitting at his computer at 2am in his home, and was[ bitten on the hand](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2010/03/12/13203971-qmi.html?cid=rssnewsweird%20news) by a 3 foot King snake that had managed to escape from his neighbour's house.  He then had the presence of mind to capture the snake before getting 911 assistance.

That's taking it to another level of pants-shitting terror, methinks.

Finally, we have this tragic story of a little boy who would have done well to have a phobia like Cael's.
