Saw this one too late to add it to the list, but this thing is pretty amazing.

It's an industrial-strength shredding machine.  I'm not really sure who their customers are, but apparently this thing can shred anything.  It's  [a juvenile delight](http://www.ssiworld.com/watch/watch-en.htm) to watch some of the stuff they throw at this thing.  Anything from cans to cars get reduced to ribbons of metal.

way cool.
