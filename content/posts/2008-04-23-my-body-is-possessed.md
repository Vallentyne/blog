I have been fighting a possession for the last few days.Â  The fight started Sunday night just after I got the boys to bed, I started feeling off.Â  I decided to go to bed and watch a movie.Â  That's when the fight really got going, we got down and dirty.Â  Freezing cold, take tylenol, feel incredibly hot, burst into sweat, repeat.Â  I have been doing that cycle for three days now.Â  My lungs feel like I inhaled a steel toe workboot at some point on Sunday.Â  I have been keeping Nikki up, once she even had to change her PJs because I sweat so much she soaked it up by contact.Â  Gross.Â  Ick.Â  She isÂ a tolerant woman.

So far my possessor has laughed at the $110 antibiotics I have been taking.Â  I have taken to carrying around tylenol all day, I dry-swallowed a couple just driving home last night.Â  Feeble drugs, they mean nothing to this particular brand of demonicÂ virus.Â  Needless to say I haven't been working out this week.Â  Looks like it will be more like P100x or so.

Demons begone.
