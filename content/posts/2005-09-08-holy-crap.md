I can only describe this as brilliant.  First off you take the spoken words from a few online dictionaries.  You know, when you aren't sure how to pronounce a word, they have a little sound file of someone saying the word for you.  Anyway, you take all of these words, and through painstaking remixing with karaoke music, you end up with a slightly robotic version of popular rock songs.  My meager language skills certainly don't do it justice, you just have to listen for yourself.  I sampled Highway to Hell, Enter Sandman and a few others, and the subtleties of each song are there, it's all very good.
