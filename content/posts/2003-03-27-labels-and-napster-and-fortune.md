Whoa what the fuck happened to me just now?
I think I bought a cellular phone somehow.
All I wanted was Cougar's "Blood on the Plow"
Not to feed the bloodthirsty corporate cash cow

But that's what you get for your Commie ideals
Face it babe, everyone lies cheats and steals
Take your best shot and see who squeals
We bet you can't afford the court of appeals
