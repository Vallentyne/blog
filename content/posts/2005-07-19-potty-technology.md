Well this is of particular interest to us at the moment, bear with me for a moment.  Quinn is resisting our best efforts to toilet train him; it seems that he is an efficiency expert and has determined that it takes far less time to just crap his pants than it does to actually tell us he is about to do so and go to the bathroom.  It's hard to argue with his logic, his powerpoint slides were compelling, 21% more playtime his way.  Even my spreadsheets showing that diaper expenditures would be reduced by 50% didn't help.  Again, his rebuttal was quite logical in that those expenses come from my budget and really don't affect his bottom (line).

Anyway, maybe this little potty tweak would assist us in getting him to see things our way.  In fact it helps everybody see things better, since it's a transparent potty.  Why this was a compelling potty modification, I still have no idea.
