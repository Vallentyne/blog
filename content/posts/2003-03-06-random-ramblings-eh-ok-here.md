Random Ramblings, eh? OK, here goes:

The travel agency across the street is advertising Paris return airfare from $480. That's only five times as much as I paid for a frickin bathing suit at lunch today. Oooo damn those bathing suit cartels and their pre-March-Break price-jacking!

Next year at Court's birthday, I wonder if Nik will sing "Happy Birthday, Mr President"? Maybe if he's reeeeeaaally really nice to her.

I wonder how long before the administrator regrets his decision to invite me to post on this blog?
