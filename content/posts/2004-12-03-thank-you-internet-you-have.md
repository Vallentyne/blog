Thank you, Internet.




You have got to see [this guy](http://www.mcrorie.ca/Index.html).




He's a one man 80's synth band.  There's a piece of video up there that is really really amazing to watch.  I mean it, check this out.  He plays two keyboards independently of each other, which isn't that amazing until you know they are strapped to his hips.  Then he has a bunch of drum pads taped all over his body so he can just whack himself in the chest for a beat.  And his shoes are wired in so he can keep the tempo going by tapping his feet.




I can hardly strum a guitar and sing at the same time, I'm sure most people would agree. 




This is just wild.
