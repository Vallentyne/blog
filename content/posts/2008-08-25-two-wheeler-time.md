Yesterday Quinn finally mastered the art of biwheeled pedal propulsion.  Cael and I were cheering him on in the park as he decided that it was high time he mastered this bike thing and took off without any trouble at all.

Now I know for sure that both boys will need new bikes in the spring, since Quinn's knees are practically up around his ears on this old bike of Dylan's.

So now it's just time to convince Cael to let go of the training wheels and we will be a fully bi-wheeled family.Â  I'm predicting it won't take long now as he watches his older brother wheel around.
