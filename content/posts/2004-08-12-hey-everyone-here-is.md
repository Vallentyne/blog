Hey everyone,

Here is an unusually large blog entry, but it was just too cute not to post. Jordy has developed a new hobby. She is becoming a singer/songwriter. I think I have her convinced to let me video tape her tonight, singing the following songs that she wrote. I canï¿½t wait. I thought I would share what our talented 8 year old songwriter has to offer the music world in the future.

Later,

Nik

_In a Car_


I'm In a car,

with all my friends.

Hangin' out,

gotta go somewhere good.

Maybe burger King,

Don't know for sure,

But somewhere good.

Havin' a blast all day,

Nothin' can ruin it, Nothing at all.

Where we're going, Won't get ruined.

Maybe somewhere else out there,

will get ruined.

But not us,

oh no,

Not us.


Love for a Family


Love for a family is very special,

Everyone needs love from a family,

oh yes.

I don't just need it,

I want it Right now.

Love for a family is very important,

If you love a family,

They will love you back.

You need to treat a family with love,

all the time.


**_It's Raining_**


It's been raining all day,

I want it to be sunny for a while.

Does it have to rain right now, or can it wait?

I guess not.

I just need a bit of sun,

Just a little bit.

Can't someone just get some sun?

Maybe if I say, "Go away rain"

It will leave me alone.

I guess it didn't work,

Maybe tomorrow, yes tomorrow,

It won't rain.


_In My Shower_


Not too cold,

Not too hot,

Just the right temperature is right for me.

Not too cold,

Not too hot,

Just the right temperature is right for me.

Knock on the door,

Let that water pour.

Washin' my hair,

Don't you dare,

Open the door,

Or the water will pour.

Washin' my body,

Pet my doggie,

I'm so dandy,

Give me some candy.

If you don't,

I will cry,

Then I'll die,

If you don't give me some candy.


**I can't fly**


I can't fly,

But I wish I could.

I stare outside, looking at the birds,

Imagining I was one.

Flying and soaring in the air,

Letting my feathers blow in the wind.

But I am just a little girl at my window,

Staring at the birds.

I've tried over and over to fly,

But I can't.

What use am I,

if I can't fly?

I try to be useful without flying,

It's just not gonna happen,

Oh, no it's not.

I wouldn't be happy in an airplane,

'Cuz it's not like a bird.

I just wanna fly.
