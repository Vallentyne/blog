Well today is our 7th anniversary (Nikki and I) and I must say that if I ever had to do it again, I would in a heartbeat.

What the calendar says happened 7 years ago feels like a long weekend at best, not years.Â  Nik, I love you so much, I can't imagine a better person to spend another weekend with.Â  If I'm still writing this lame blog in another 7 years, I swear it won't feel any different than the day we were married (although I imagine that I will end up with a little less hair by the 14th).Â  Living with you is the best thing that's ever happened to me.Â  Thank you for letting me hang around this long....Â  :-)

Love you sweetheart.
