Another family update today.

First off, Jordy has long been waiting for us to get some Christmas decorating done, and so she was pleasantly surprised when we hauled the tree and boxes up last night and got right down to it. She was quite cute about the whole thing. Lots of good fun, and the house looks really good.

Quinn was also able to take part in the decorating activities for the first time, and while he didn't necessarily "get" what we were doing, he did have lots of comments, eat a lot of popcorn and generally ran around while the rest of us decorated.

Cael has been making some big strides towards walking. (That's a pun. Because "strides" can be used two ways. Get it? Did I flog that one a bit too much? Ok, so let's jump back to the news (there's another pun)). As you [may remember](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/11/some-family-news-today.htm) he was working on being able to shove his huge bulk around the floor. Well, now he is standing, or rather leaning against the furniture. He's pretty smug about it too, because his destructive capacity is now being amplified by gravity. His Pampered butt regularly makes contact with the floor with about the same impact as a pile driver. We have warned Jordy and Quinn to stay away from the "kill zone" underneath Cael when he's standing, but Harvey doesn't seem to get it. It makes us very worried for his longevity.

You can see the subtle scheming going on behind those blue eyes here:
