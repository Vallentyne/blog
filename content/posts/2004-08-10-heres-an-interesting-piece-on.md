Here's [an interesting piece](http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1279815,00.html?=rss) on a volcanic island that could drop a huge chunk of rock into the Atlantic, and trigger mega-tsunamis (huge tidal waves 300 feet high travelling at 560mph).

Apparently nobody wants to listen to the geeks that are trying to warn people about this.  It's like the plot of some sort of natural disaster movie, where the geeks know something terrible will happen and nobody wants to listen to them, you know?  It's something like that.
