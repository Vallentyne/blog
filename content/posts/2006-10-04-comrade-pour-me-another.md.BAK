Russian officials have decided that enough is enough, and they have announced last call for Latvians.Â  Russian customs officers have discovered a [mile-long vodka pipeline](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/04/vodka_pipeline/) across the border to Latvia.Â  Smugglers (or brilliant entrepreneurs as I like to call these guys) managed to lay this pipe 6 feet underground somehow unnoticed.Â  It would still be unnoticed if someone hadn't had the bright idea of planting some trees.Â  Just how do you go about digging a six foot trench across international borders and not get noticed, anyway?Â  Then again, this is Canada, and you could probably export Saskatchewan to the U.S. without anybody noticing for a few days at least (that's not to slight Saskatchewaners, but rather is meant to describe just how undefended our border is.Â  At least for now.)

Yes, I realize that the last three (!) posts have been about alcohol, and yes, I am seeking counseling about my alcoblogism(tm).Â  Really, it's just a strange coincidence.Â  Really.
