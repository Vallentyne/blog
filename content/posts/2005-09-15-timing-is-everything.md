Unbelievably, right after my [post yesterday](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/he_comes_he_eat.html) about how Cael likes to eat, he broke his crib this morning by jumping up and down in it.  I mean, he broke the metal bracket that holds the thing together.  We literally have to throw the thing out now.

What a kid.
