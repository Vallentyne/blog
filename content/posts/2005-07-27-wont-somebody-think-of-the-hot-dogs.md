Incredibly [cool new safety feature](http://www.sawstop.com/index.htm) for power tools, it's a system that can detect when a saw blade is cutting through something that isn't wood, such as say, the very digits you are using to push the wood through the saw.  You get away with a nick instead of a stump.  Check out the [videos of this thing](http://www.sawstop.com/media/Table%20Saw%20-%20Quicktime%20high.mov) in action, it's awesome.  They even have [slow motion videos](http://www.sawstop.com/how-it-works-videos.htm).  The future products also look as impressive.

It's proof that we really need more geek woodworkers out there to think of these things, it's a brilliant use of simple technology to save important fingers (not that there are any unimportant ones).

High School Shop teachers will give this one-and-a-half thumbs up for sure.  But really, the big winners here are the hot dogs used to test this thing.
