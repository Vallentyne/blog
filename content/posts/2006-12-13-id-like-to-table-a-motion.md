I have seen it around the webs lots lately, so another me-too post of this thing just can't hurt.

I would suggest that this table is probably the coolest piece of furniture I have ever seen.  There's just nothing quite like it.  Click on the videos and watch this baby move.Â  It's like furniture porn (never thought you would read that sentence, eh?).

It's made by a company with one of those web sites that finds it vulgar to put an actual price up for people to see.  It's like a "If you have to ask you can't afford it" thing.  Still, way way cool table.
