Hey.

Just to finish off the Pre TPB hype week, it's now T-3 for the premiere.  Is your bottle of rum ready?  What about your attire?  Don't fail to remember the fake smokes, wraparound shades, gold chains, high heels (well, depending on which character you choose, and from which episode), headband, chest hair, gun, profanity, and disregard for the law.

I may have forgotten a few things, but you get the gist of it.  Be at Gibson's or be square.  I will have to ask if she's going to have pickled eggs, cause I can't get enough of those delicious things.  Call it an Easter tie-in if you will.

Now it's back to the riveting work that pays the bills.
