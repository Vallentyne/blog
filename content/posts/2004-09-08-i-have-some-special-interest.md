I have some special interest stories to share here today.

First off, there's a link for us parents, [Having Kids Makes You Thick.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/08/kids_make_you_thick/)  It's on The Register, which should be taken with a grain of salt usually, but maybe you should use two grains this time, since they quote a British quasi-tabloid.  Here's an excerpt:


<blockquote>ï¿½It explains why parents think their kid is the smartest in class or the best athlete, even if that child is as dumb as a box of rocks or needs a calendar to time a 100-yard sprint. People who before were intelligent and open-minded turn into raving lunatics who want to blame a teacher or sports coach every time their mediocre child fails.ï¿½</blockquote>


Funny stuff, but with a bit of truth that I [have noticed before.](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/01/only-weekly-posts-you-say-pity.htm)

Here's an interesting bit:  Police in Paris have discovered a movie theatre in the catacombs under the city.  It had a stocked bar, power, phone lines and a full size projector and screen.  Here's the link, [from Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/08/underground_movies.html).  It's amazing.  Once again stealing a quote:


<blockquote>Three days later, when the police returned accompanied by experts from the French electricity board to see where the power was coming from, the phone and electricity lines had been cut and a note was lying in the middle of the floor: "Do not," it said, "try to find us."</blockquote>


Recently we had been reminiscing about attacking friends with a toy airplane.  Well, in that  same vein, [here's a link](http://homepage.mac.com/keithgreenstein/Flapper/PhotoAlbum41.html) (again from Boing Boing) to a site that has plans for a paper airplane that flaps it's wings, which if it works is pretty amazing.  And, of course what's more threatening than a stationary unmanned [20 ft military drone](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/whirladrone-020935.php) that just whirls around in one place?  Scary.

And finally, here's a link I can't visit at work since it's blocked, so visit carefully.  I just know Kyle is going to try this, it's [pornogami](http://underground.zork.net/index.html), or rather sexually explicit origami.  Again, The Register is a gold mine for information of this magnitude.  Here's a few links they provide;[ The Missionary](http://underground.zork.net/people_together.html#The%20Missionary), and [Bill and Monica](http://underground.zork.net/people_together.html#Bill%20And%20Monica).  Please note that I have NOT vetted those links, although I must say I'm a little interested to see what they look like....

that should be enough to keep you going for a little while.
