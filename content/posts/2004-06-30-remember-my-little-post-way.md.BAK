Remember my little [post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/06/so-many-news-articles-so-little-time.htm) way back yesterday about not using Internet Explorer anymore?  [Here's why.](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/29/1913222)




It's malicious code that installs silently on your browser and is specifically looking to capture your banking  passwords.




Yep, that's a real good browser right there.  Now don't get me wrong, IE could be fine if they just fixed the damn bugs.  I know, Mozilla and the others don't have the market penetration to really get people looking for bugs like this, but really, do you care?  It's your money were talking about here.




Get off IE now.
