How timely, given my post just [a few days ago](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/big_huggy_is_wa.html) about a breathing monitor, here's the next way cool baby related gadgetry.

It's basically 4 mechanical feet that you put underneath the legs of the baby's crib.  They then rock the crib back and forth for a preset amount of time and "[emulates the suspension in a car](http://beta.news.com.com/2061-10801_3-5876053.html)".  I can almost hear the machine whining under the strain of rocking Cael to sleep.  Actually I must say that none of our kids have any trouble getting to sleep (maybe with the exception of Quinn).

Oh man, that sounds sweet.  I wonder if they make one for grownups?  So, there you go, the perfect gift for young Xavier.  Or rather, it's really a gift for Jim and Ali.
