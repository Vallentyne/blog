[They Might Be Giants](http://www.theymightbegiants.com/) (who until now I had never actually heard) released a kids CD called Here Comes Science, and it's happy, catchy, and scientifically accurate.Â  Good lord, but this makes me happy.Â  It will be purchased for my kids by the end of the day.Â  My geeky heart overflows with joy.Â  The band website has lots of good stuff, but I stole the links for these videos and they are brilliant, check 'em out.

GO and get it on iTunes or [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Science-Amazon-com-Exclusive/dp/B002FKZ4UO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1252295558&sr=8-1).  Go on.  Go ahead, I'll wait here.

I saw this on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/08/they-might-be-giants-1.html) first, as usual.
