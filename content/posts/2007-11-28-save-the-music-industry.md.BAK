Canoe.ca is running a bit of a series of articles on the music industry, downloading, sales, torrents, and the whole ball of wax.Â  I've been following it for a few days in the Ottawa Sun and online, it's not a bad series generally.Â  Most of the ideas aren't new, or even novel, but it does seem to be taking absolutely forever for the industry to figure things out.Â  One particularly good article that summarizes things pretty well is [here](http://jam.canoe.ca/Microsite/Music/Crossroads/2007/11/27/4689350-sun.html).

It covers the basics: compete with free or lose everything, our loyalty doesn't come free or cheap, piracy will always exist if you don't give us what we want and how we want it, and my favourite: stop making sucky music.

Anyway, have a read, it's pretty good stuff.
