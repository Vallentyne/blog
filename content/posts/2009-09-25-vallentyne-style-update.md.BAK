It's been a while since I did a post about the kids, since this is technically our family's blog I guess that means I haven't been sharing very well.Â  Normally that would mean I have to say I'm sorry, and potentially spend some time alone in my room.Â  As any parent knows, the thought of spending alone time at home is a fantasy that most of us would kill for, so it just doesn't hold the same power over us.

Anyway, let's fix that now, Jordy first.Â  She is settling into grade 9 rather well so far.Â  The new class schedule, new teachers and responsibilities are pretty much the way I remember grade 9.Â  The biggest difference I can see is how much cooler Jordy is than I was.Â  Seriously, this kid has a fully developed sense of style that I definitely lacked in grade 9.Â  She knows exactly what clothes to wear, how she wants her hair and spends a not inconsiderable amount of time getting it just right.Â  Exactly how much time is a subject of much discussion at our house, with personal grooming edging out other less important activities, like eating breakfast properly instead of a handful of dry cereal shoved into her mouth as she runs out the door.Â  As the weather changes I can see another familiar "discussion" looming: Canadian Winters and How to Dress in Them So You Don't Look Like You Live On The Street, Don't Your Parents Care About You?Â  A favourite, to be sure.

Quinn's Grade 2 teacher is a very nice lady who seems to be a perfect fit for him this year.Â  She by her own admission is ever so slightly obsessive about order and neatness in her classroom.Â  Quinn is still the neatest child in the house by a wide margin, even if that tendency is slipping ever so slightly as he grows older.Â  We couldn't ask for more, and he seems to be doing well so far.Â  Personal appearance has not traditionally been high on his list to date, but in the last week or two he has been requesting to have his shower early enough at night so that he has time enough to blow his own hair dry.Â  His goal is to have hair as soft as Jordy's, so you can see the influence trickling down here.Â  Fortunately his quest for the perfect hairstyle does not prevent him from getting absolutely dirty from head to toe while playing with his brother, which is a kid's universal right.

Cael is thriving this year in senior kindergarten, even more so than I thought he would.Â  He is really starting to figure out reading, sounding out words that he doesn't already know and his writing skills are really improving.Â  He goes to school in the afternoons now, which makes for a better flow to his day and avoids the boring afternoon syndrome he had last year when he had to wait for his brother to come home from school.Â  Cael of course absolutely owns the title of best dressed kid in the class, and always has.Â  His outfit for the first day of school this year rocked so hard that The Breakfast Club called and invited him to their next meeting.
