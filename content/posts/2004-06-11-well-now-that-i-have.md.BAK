Well, now that I have stopped the sober introspection brought on by Nik's excellent poem, I'm ready to post something completely inane again.

We have bunnies in the backyard.  Wild ones.  As these things always go, it started with one bunny (well I know it actually must have been two, but I only saw one at a time) here and there hopping cutely through the long grass behind our house.

Then we actually saw three bunnies in the backyard.  Then five.  They're so cute.  Nikki and Jordy love the bunnies and throw carrots out the window every chance they get to keep the bunnies fat and happy.  I hear "Oh, can't we get a bunny?  Please please please?"  Harvey is quite interested in bunnies also, but on a more "Please let me chase the bunnies around" level.  I'm not allowed to allow Harvey to do that, for fear of sleeping on the couch.

I myself am fine with the bunny relationship we already have; bunnies are around, they poop outside, and we don't worry about them actually escaping outside cause that's where they live.  In my opinion, it's a perfect situation.

So, let's just think about that situation for a minute more.  The bunnies hop around.  They are well fed (between our groceries flying out the window and the neighbour's vegetable garden they're doing just fine).  They exist in a safe environment where dogs are yelled at and made to feel stupid for chasing bunnies.  What do you suppose might eventually happen in a given environment like that?  I'll tell you:

Some day soon we will be sitting down for lunch in the kitchen on a sunny weekend afternoon.  We will hear a distant rumbling.  It's an airplane, we all assume.  But it's not.  It's getting closer.  There seems to be more bunnies in the backyard than usual.  We look up out the back window in time to see the rising tsunami of brown fur, cute, twitchy, whiskered, fluffy, destructive brown fur.  The "bunnami" will eradicate all traces of our neighbourhood, leaving only a wasteland populated with tidepools of "cute" bunnies.  The wreckage will serve as a silent, hopping reminder to humans:

Bunnies are evil, and will take you down if given a chance.
