I have been meaning to write something about this for a while now.  I have long noticed that of the small amount of spam I actually get in my inbox, the wonderfully inventive spammers have really been stepping it up on the sender names.  The quality is certainly increasing, even if it only seems to be a random dictionary pairing, it's still making some pretty funny combinations.Â  Here's a small sample from my very own inbox over the last few days.

Nonalcoholic T. Cliffhangers
Steamies M. Necktie
Indemnified T. Less
Cephalus Welcome
Will U. Embankments
Barreled K. Tolerates
Constitutionality C. Irresolute
Minutiae L. Stooge
Refurnishes F. Astuteness

I am particularly fond of Steamies M. Necktie, but if we (heaven forbid) have any more children, I will definitely be naming he/she Minutiae.
