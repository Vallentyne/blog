Some days the blog content just falls into place, like today.

First we have the story of a guy who was driving his car on the 401, speeding, and [watching a porno at the same time](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/driver+watching+adult+flick+while+allegedly+speeding/1811936/story.html).Â  No word on whether he was using his turn signals or not.Â  He's down one hand on the wheel by my count.Â  Darwin Award wannabe I guess.

Then my personal favourite; a grandmother out for a little drive with her grandkids and decided to [stop by the casino](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2009/07/21/10207476-ap.html?cid=rssnewsweird%20news) for a spell.Â  Hm, these kids can't come inside, so let's just leave them outside in the car (aged 2 and 14).Â  Sure, that's the thing to do.Â  Needless to say, grandma got sentenced to 14 months of house arrest, which means that the 14 year old now has to sneak into the casino to play grandma's slots for her.Â  These slot machines don't play themselves, dammit.

This brings to mind the following graphic, which I stole from the Discovery Magazine blog, [Bad Astronomy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/arizona-is-6000-years-old/).Â  Rather fitting, isn't it?
