Well, I'm a little late in writing about it, but my very cool wife Nikki got us tickets to go and see Mr. Lahey and Randy who are touring Canada on The Randy is Beautiful tour at the moment. We saw them at Algonquin College on Monday night, and despite both of us being really tired and hardly wanting to go we had a great time. It was a very funny mix of character skits and frank discussion about the Trailer Park Boys show and assorted projects. Some good stuff on the upcoming Season 6, and the feature movie "The Big Dirty", which I checked [IMDB ](http://www.imdb.com)for and realized that they are again taking some liberties with the story line and plot arc. It makes a whole lot of sense now that I read it, but basically the movie covers events that don't occur in the TV storyline. [Check it out.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425601/)

I have a few pictures to share, coming soon.

Update: Here we go with some pics

*Update: I misspelled Lahey in the original post.... imagine the nerve.
