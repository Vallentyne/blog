Well the summer is almost here, we are in that golden moment where school's end is imminent, the weather is getting rather predictably good, the sense of good times to come is palpable.Â  The kids are looking forward to having some time off, and even Nikki is looking forward to the summer, where in years past there was usually a slight hint of dread: "what are we going to DO all day?".Â  This year it's looking up since the kids are even more fun to do stuff with than ever, where before we seemed to be hampered sometimes by the age of the boys.Â  Some random samplings of late:

Jordy's grade 8 graduation is almost here, which is a crazy thought all by itself.Â  Party preparations are in full swing, there will be some number of her friends in our backyard next week.Â  No worries though, she is actually turning into the teenager she was threatening to do for the last couple of years, which is to say she is awesome.Â  We will still have some academic fun to work through next year, no doubt, but she continues to grow and mature into a wonderful person.

Quinn and I were talking recently about what kind of job he might end up with as a grown up.Â  Lately he had been thinking he would become an artist and sell his art in a shop.Â  I was explaining that the way to make your life fun was to find work that you love to do, so you don't get bored of it.Â  We mulled over a few things, and then I mentioned that there were [people](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/06/lego-for-a-living-conversation-with-a-master-builder/) who built [Lego models for a living](http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/10/60764), creating the sets that Quinn loves oh so much.Â  Well, that was a revelation to say the least, you could get paid to play with toys for a living?Â  Needless to say, Quinn now has a new professional goal that combines his love of Lego and his creativity.

Cael and Nikki and I had some good quality time on Friday and Saturday since Jordy was in BC, and Quinn was staying with Nanny and Poppy.Â  We went to see Night at the Museum 2, and we enjoyed it quite a bit, if [not quite as much as Up](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/06/01/up-rocks/).Â  Cael also set the agenda on exactly how many cuddles there were to be with each of us, so I think he had a pretty good time overall.

Lloyd is still the best puppy around, he continues to prove to be very trainable, and listens incredibly well for a 13 week old dog.Â  It's a wonder he can hear anything we say over the constant rumbling of his belly. He is getting over 3 cups of food a day now, and weighs over 35 pounds.Â  It's getting crazy folks, but he is still so frigging cute that he gets away with any missteps with ease.Â  There's just no defense against that face.Â  Harvey was never so thrilled that Melvin came over on Sunday to take Lloyd's playtime duties, although I would say that he was about 15% miffed that he wasn't the plaything of choice.Â  He has more than adjusted to Lloyd's energy, he is anxiously waiting every morning for Lloyd to be released from his cage, whining and ready to go.Â  They are best buddies now.
