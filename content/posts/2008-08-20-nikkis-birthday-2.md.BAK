Just wanted to be sure to wish Nikki a Happy Birthday here, even though I have emailed and Facebooked, and SMSed the same message to her already today.Â  Technology is wonderful, but it can be a tad much at times...

Love you sweetheart!Â  Looking fine at 29....

btw, Nikki is surprised because I brought my torch, which I normally leave at home, but in this case I have kept tucked behind my ear for safe keeping.Â  You should take care of your torch....
