[Toads that evolve longer legs move faster, and jump farther than short-legged ones](http://today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2006-02-15T180335Z_01_L15231777_RTRUKOC_0_US-ENVIRONMENT-TOADS.xml).  I think I speak for the majority of the non-scientific community when I say:  Duh!

Ok, not to disparage the work of scientists everywhere, but come on guys.  Long-legged poisonous toads **are **extra deathy, but not quite as deathy as the ones that have evolved flamethrower tongues.  Thank goodness we have press releases like this to keep us safe.  Or at least the residents of Australia, where the toads live.
