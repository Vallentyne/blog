Hey everyone!

How goes everything?  I feel refreshed and rejuvenated and thoroughly invigorated being back at work.  NOT!  I am anxiously looking forward to running out of here to meet Little Vallentyne!!!

Guaranteed I am not the only one this anxious for the little guy to make his appearance.  I'm quite sure his parents are more than ready!  I have got lots of film for my camera, and lots of butterflies in my tummy - let's get going!!!

Must run and get busy here at work!  See everyone soon!
