Without getting too far into personal territory, which I try to avoid as a rule here, I think most men can appreciate this gem from xkcd, the only web comic I subscribe to and read every day.Â  Nikki can, ahem, attest to why I would post this.Â  In general, with practice, I become better at things.Â  Not undoing bra straps.Â  I can't understand for the life of me why they have to be so finicky.Â  Why not have a snap, or velcro, or a buckle of some sort, or any other number of common fasteners?Â  It's crazy.

I can only suggest you read [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/) if you are a geek since the content there is heavily skewed into the nerdy spectrum, but it's brilliant.
