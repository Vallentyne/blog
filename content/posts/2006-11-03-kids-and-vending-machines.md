I caught this post on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) and it reminded me so much of our own kids (well, Cael mostly) that I am stealing all of the content.  The gist of the series of links is the same:  parent is standing right there, kid somehow still manages to get inside one of those stuffed animal vending machines with the claw, fire department gets called, hilarity ensues.

The pictures alone are worth the click, these kids are hamming it up from inside the machines.  It's not that hard for anyone who knows Cael to imagine him in there, grinning through the glass.

Enjoy:

It's gold.
