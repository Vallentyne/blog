First off, let me just say that this is a very convincing illusion.  I'm not sure if this whole video itself has been doctored, or the table is tricked somehow, but overall this is very very cool.  I stole this from Metafilter, I believe.

The coin thing looks and feels like regular (although very impressive) sleight of hand, but the business with the salt shaker had my jaw drop open.  Check it out.  A little long, and not in English, but it's worth it.
