Here's a poem Jordy wrote at school, I thought at first she just copied it from a textbook when she showed it to me.    The teacher gave the class the structure (I am..., I see..., etc.) and the rest is hers.  It's excellent and thoughtful and deep.  I'm busting with pride about this, she has her Mom's gift with poetry.  I just wish she didn't have to write about this topic, it would be nice if 10 year old girls didn't know about war or fear or suffering.

I am Worthy and Fearful
By Jordynn Vachon-Vallentyne

I am worthy and fearful
I wonder if I will survive.
I hear my children crying and saying goodbye.
I see them waving to me as I leave.
I want this horrible nightmare to end.
I am worthy and fearful.

I pretend that I am hugging all my family members.
I feel the warmth of the fireplace.
I touch the cozy covers of my bed at home.
I worry that I will not make it.
I cry to see my friends suffering.
I am worthy and fearful.

I understand that I have to fight.
I say to myself, â€œI can do this.â€
I dream that there is no war.
I try not to think of the war.
I hope that the war will end soon.
I am worth and fearful.
