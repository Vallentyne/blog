You may wonder what PowerPoint (yes Microsoft PowerPoint, the presentation software) has to do with my marriage.  I think it's a good measuring stick for just how patient Nikki is with me, and hopefully by measuring that I can estimate how much she loves me.  Let me explain.

When I installed the PC at home, I put the things we use all of the time on there, Outlook, Word, Excel, FireFox, etc.  I purposely didn't put PowerPoint on because I hate that product and I was trying to save some space.  What I really didn't think too much about was how many people send slide shows in email messages with PowerPoint.  These messages come into Nikki's inbox, where she reads them.  And then she replies to the person, thanking them for the message and explaining how she would love to look at the attachment but she doesn't have PowerPoint.  And she is sure each time to copy me on the message.  And each time I get one of these messages I re-make a mental promise to myself to install PowerPoint at home the very next time I'm at the computer.  And each time I do that, I forget.  This happens quite often and has been going on for quite a while now, say about 2 years.  It has been about that long since I reinstalled the PC.  That right there is a very patient woman-who-is-home-alone-with-3-children- all-day-and-only-has-email-as-her-single-connection-to-the-outside-world.  She quietly and subtly reminds me every time, and hasn't succumbed to the frustration and killed me with a cast iron frying pan (yet).
That's love folks.  I owe that woman more than my life, I owe her 5-10 minutes of file copying and clicking "Next".

Sorry baby.  :-)
