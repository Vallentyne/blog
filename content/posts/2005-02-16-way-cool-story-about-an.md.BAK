Way [cool story](http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Creature-from-the-deep/2005/02/06/1107625063911.html?oneclick=true) about an [oarfish](http://www.amonline.net.au/fishes/fishfacts/fish/rglesne.htm) (which I didn't know existed).  They can grow anywhere from 9 meters to 17 meters long, which is definitely a sea monster in my book.  Wow.

You can't look at the link without subscribing to the site first, which is stupid, so I didn't.  Instead the excellent [Boing Boing has the goods](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/09/sea_serpent.html).  In fact, since over 90% of the content here comes from Boing Boing, why don't you just start reading it yourself?

Oh, you already are.  Gotcha.
