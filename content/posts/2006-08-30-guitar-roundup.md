Ok, so here's some videos to while the time away.

First, a style of playing I had never seen before, [tap guitar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRRF_M2T-vY).   That's pretty cool right there.
Then we have some even crazier [ukulele playing](http://youtube.com/watch?v=-RrsSsu-fDM&search=smeck), that's one caffeinated dude.

Finally a cover version of a song that is [much better than the original](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ioKEDgnfs8) in my opinion.Â  The guitar is ok, but this guy's voice is what really makes it good.

Links stolen liberally from all over the Internet, but [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net) and [Wired](http://wired.com) are the sources in this case.
