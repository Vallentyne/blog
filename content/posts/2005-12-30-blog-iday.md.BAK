Or is that a blog-cation?  Anyway you look at it, I've definitely been off, both work and blog for the past week.  Many apologies to anybody looking for news here, but watcha gonna do?  A little break is nice once in a while.

As for happenings here, well it's the same as always, very hectic, very fun.  Christmas was great, the family and children were festive and we all had a very good, very relaxing time.  Santa came by and he must have tripped over the dog because he spilled out a huge pile of presents for the kids, which in all honesty they haven't even seen the bottom of yet.  Santa came by and brought me a nice gift as well, a gym membership.  I'm not sure if that is a hint or not.  Anyway, it's at [Astral Fitness](http://www.astralfitness.com) just around the corner from us, and it's a great place to work out.

Except that now I can't move my arms and I'm typing this with one big toe.  Nikki just laughs at me, and the kids are all pummeling me into submission since I'm as weak as a kitten.

I'm sure this will pass eventually, right?
