Give me points for being completely late and pointing out something incredibly obvious here, but really, have you not noticed that the Internet is replacing regular old TV at a fantastic pace?  I mean the channel surfing part of TV, as opposed to the part where you watch something at length.  If you are just after a quick 2 or 3 minute bit of silliness/information then there's just no way TV can compete.  To that end, here's 7 or 8 minutes worth of weird crap to surf through.

A way too strange example how life is stranger than fiction, this "[caterpillar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeNggIGSKH8)" looks like something out of a Jim Henson shop somewhere, or computer animated even.  It's kind of cuddly, but looks fake.

Next we have another [Darth Vader](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blbv4WFriM) video, this one a careful edit job from "Empire Strikes Back", wherein Darth has a sudden case of the immaturities.  Funny, and of course, nerdy.

Then a music video from a favourite band of ours, Ok Go.  I first saw them dance to one of their songs on Mad TV, and the song and performance were so memorable and catchy I bought their album shortly afterwards.  Watching these guys dance to one of their own songs should not be this entertaining, but it was obvious they spent a lot of time getting it just right, and it was funny.  Anyway, in the very same vein, this is a music video for another song of theirs and it's all done on treadmills.  The care and practice taken here is incredible, and once again, funny.  [Have a look](http://youtube.com/watch?v=pv5zWaTEVkI).  It's good good stuff.
