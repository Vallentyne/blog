Although I [gave Australia a hard time recently](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/28/canada-is-too-dangerous-for-australians/), it doesn't have a monopoly on truly scary-assed insects.  I saw this [list of really gross and scary bugs](http://www.cracked.com/article_15816_5-most-horrifying-bugs-in-world.html) that make you once again glad you live in Canada with harsh winters that tend to take the rough edges off most of our bugs.  Have a gander at those suckers, man!  The wasp is especially terrifying and looks like a cheap photoshop job.  That's just crazy.  I would be screaming like a little girl if one of those things lumbered by.

Then it's off to something a lot less terrifying, but more fascinating.  It's a [segment of a nature show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQERRbU23bU) about ants and the colonies they build.  The researchers poured concrete into an ant colony they found, 10 tons of concrete.  Then they excavated it to study how the ants work.  It's amazing.  We could probably stand to study how they do it, there's a lot to learn from them.  Very neat stuff.
