I must say that my introduction to YouTube and Google Video have greatly improved the quality of my online life.  Viewing grainy and pixellated video online is certainly the future, and I must tell you; it's so bright, I gotta wear shades.

Ok, here is what's cookin' today.

These guys are just way, way too good.  [Martial art tumbling and aerial craziness](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6025653480087726253&q=ryouko) that makes you wonder what you are doing just sitting there.  Lots and lots more [here](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=ryouko&page=1&lv=0&so=0).  Wow.

[Real life Simpsons intro](http://youtube.com/watch?v=49IDp76kjPw).  Too cool.

And another [Ninja-related bit of humour](http://askaninja.blogspot.com/), Nikki noticed that I seem to be particularly susceptible to Ninja humour, as noted [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/11/thank_god_for_d_1.html), and [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/11/new_dr_mcninja.html).  Why that is, I have no idea.  It may have something to do with how ninjas are just so cool, or it might have something to do with the fact that if I don't find them funny, they may kill me.  Or it might just be a personal character flaw.... nah.

Credit for these things goes to the usual sources: Metafilter, Boing Boing, et al.
