G-1 today, and things are at a fever pitch.  Well, a slow simmer anyway.  The garage is busting with junk, and will continue to be since there is rain in the forecast for tomorrow morning.  Drat.  I still have to find a good way to hang up all of the clothing we have ready to go, there is still a ton of toys and things to price, the garage is still in a shambles and we need about 17 more tables.  It's all under control.

Yikes.

The big question is: at what time will hardcore garage salers show up on a rainy Saturday morning?  We have plans to open the doors at 6:30, but will that be early enough?  Tough to know.

In any case, Jordy is ready with her cookies, coffee, and juice to rake in some serious dough.  There's a real business model.  Nikki bakes the cookies, we will be making the coffee and juice and absorb all costs, and Jordy sells the stuff for pure profit.  Man, that would be sweet.

I'm currently reading yet another Bob Dylan biography that Nikki bought me for my birthday.  It's quite good, and slightly more interesting than [the last one I read](http://www.vallentyne.com/family/2003_05_01_archive.htm), mostly because this one focuses only on Bob, and not anybody else.  He's an interesting character.  Even more evidence in this one that Bob was frustrating his peers with refusing to appear at rallies, or any political event, although he continually wrote songs that were quickly adopted as cultural anthems for the revolutionaries of the time.  He was always careful to make the songs timeless, never mentioning specific names that would date the songs too quickly.  He is once again quoted as saying that he thought "Masters of War" would sell.  Perhaps that wasn't his motivation for writing it in the first place, but it's still really interesting.

I will have more here on that when I finish it, maybe.
