If you are like me a calculator is something that essentially changed your life back in grade school.Â  Those dreaded times tables became child's play with your trusty calculator handy.Â  OK so maybe the times tables weren't so bad, but there were bigger nastier mathematical operations lurking in your future, and my trusty buddy would be there.

Years pass, and now I spend most of my time on my laptop.Â  But since my brain doesn't get younger, I still rely on a calculator, which for years now has looked more or less like this.

The Windows XP calculator.Â  Serviceable, and functional to be sure.Â  Perhaps not terribly exciting though, and lacking in personality.

Lately though, my attention has been captured by a flashier model.Â  Windows 10 has brought many gifts, but one of the least known is the calculator...Â  Sure, it gets the job done with the regular math related stuff, and is very touch-friendly since that's how we roll these days.

But what most people don't know is just how life changing (yes, life changing) this calculator can be.Â  For instance, just click the hamburger and see what you get with this beauty.

Yes folks, this calculator is also a CONVERTER of things; ever needed to know how many inches there are in 3 centimeters?Â  We got you covered.Â  How about how many teaspoons in 90 milliliters?Â  Yep we got that too.

Even better, there are other measurement suggestions given for each conversion.Â  For instance, 100Km/h when converted to miles/h looks like this.

1.38 horses folks.Â  That's something I wish I had known before.... Although the Knots conversion is also useful since I never really understood that before now.Â  It doesn't take long to play around and find some other fun stuff.

Bathtubs being a very reasonable quantity of measure, of course.

So, as if you needed another reason to use Windows 10 I would argue that this feature ALONE might even convert you.

(see what I did there?)
