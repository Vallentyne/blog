Oh man, this is just too much.  Are they actively TRYING to tick me off?  Winnipeg, you really don't want to take us on, do you?

After we [scoffed](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/10/skate-record-in-mexico-city-pah/) at Mexico City's feeble attempts at a World Record in a skating conga line, then comes along the pretender. Winnipeg, with it's barely discernible icy sidewalk, [lamely](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/29/winnipeg-has-the-longest-rink/) tries to say they have the longest skating rink in the world.  Well sure, if you happen to be skating on one leg, or are actually two dimensional, or have the body of an Olsen twin, since this thing is more like skating on an icy 2x4 than [a real rink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rideau_Canal).

Now, Winnipeg appears to be ticking off everybody [by staging a conga line](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/02/18/4857105-cp.html), huh just like Mexico City did, only they were strung out along that ridiculous skating path.  It's go time, people.  What are the NCC or the Winterlude people going to do about this?  It's an outrage.  We should get our crap together and pound Winnipeg into oblivion (well, skating-conga-line oblivion).  With a little organization Ottawa could make these two cities whimper for skate mercy.

Is anybody else outraged about this sham of a publicity stunt?
