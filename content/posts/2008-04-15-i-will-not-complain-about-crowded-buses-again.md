[That is all](http://www.chilloutzone.de/files/08040701.html).

Notice the quiet determination to just get squished in there, nobody gets all that upset or concerned.  There is just the certainty that all of those people will fit, even if only with the gloved hand of the pusher assisting.  Talk about claustrophobia, that would make anybody freak out.  Notice the windows when the train goes by, everybody is exactly where they got smushed when the doors closed.

And the bonus round of extreme claustrophobia goes to this poor man.Â  He went for a smoke and ended up stuck in an elevator for 41 hours.Â  I don't think I would be quite the same coming out of there.Â  The security camera footage is [difficult to watch](http://www.newyorker.com/online/video/2008/04/21/080421_elevators)....

Saw that one on Neatorama.
