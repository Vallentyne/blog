Whoa, Nik!

I guess I had better let that girl get outside amongst the adults more often.  Too much baby stuff.

Now lookit.  You people do know this isn't email, right?  I mean you are supposed to contribute something to the discussion at hand.  I know we aren't discussing anything in particular, don't cloud the issue.  The point is, should I clear the rink of the more than 1 foot of snow on it right now so that we can have another skating party?  That is the question.  I am willing, but only if you people all commit to coming, and you have to skate ok?  No wimpy running around on the ice in your boots.

Now let's discuss.
