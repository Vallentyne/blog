I would offer [this man](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/06/20/5940501-ap.html) as proof of at least #3, #7, #9, #12 and of course #1.Â  He probably seriously freaked out his ex-girlfriend, whom he was stalking at the time.Â  At best he's just an honorable mention, a (re)poseur in the game of living unknown inside someone else's home.Â  That distinction is still held by the [closet lady](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/06/02/train-of-thought/), hands down, the best ever.
