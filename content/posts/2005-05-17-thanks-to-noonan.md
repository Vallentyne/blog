I was checking [Noonan's blog](http://www.jjnoonan.ca/blog/index.html) for updates (he just may be the least prolific writer who is also a writer in his day job.  Come on man, there's just no excuse, you do have an English degree, don't you?) and noticed that John Prine is coming to Blusefest this year.  This made me go to the Bluesfest website to check out the rest of the lineup.  Which made me start thinking of getting some folks together to go and see Johnny in the flesh (July 17, it's a Sunday which sort of blows, but I'm old and it doesn't matter anymore so I still want to go).  Which made me go to John Prine's [website](http://www.ohboy.com).  Which made me notice/remember that John has a new CD out.  Which made me realize that I really want it.  Which made me think I had better not buy it or Nikki will kill me, she says she can never get me anything I really want because I just either don't really want for anything (which makes me think I'm incredibly spoiled) or I just go and get anything I do want.

And all of this made me realize that I haven't done any work in almost 25 minutes.  Which made me wonder if I have an attention deficit disorder of some sort.....
