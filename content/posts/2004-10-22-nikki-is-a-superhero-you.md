Nikki is a superhero. You don't know it because she disguises it so well, though. It's her suburban Mom alter-ego. Her super-powers include:



	  * being able to yawn without opening her mouth
	  * cooking for many many humans while remaining beautiful
	  * swimming 1km without vomiting
	  * almost folding her eyelids backwards
	  * restraining a feral baby with one arm
	  * uber-planning and scheduling abilities

There are certainly others.

Keep that in mind when you deal with her, she's always fighting for the side of good.
