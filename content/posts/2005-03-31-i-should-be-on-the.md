I should be on the bus going home right now, but I thought I would leave you with these:

First, we have [this guy](http://www.beinart.com.au/page/page/544347.htm), who apparently spends his time in what I can only describe as incredibly strange ways.  He takes plastic dolls and makes montrous mutations from them.  It's right out of a horror movie, and vaguely disturbing.  Boing Boing called them Toddlerpedes, and that makes me even more freaked out somehow.

Then, on a lighter note, a freaking awesome, if strange, business.  It's the [Unfortunate Animal of the Month Club](http://www.morbidtendencies.com/botmc-details.html).  Basically you suscribe to this club and they will make you a one-of-a-kind stuffed animal with way more than the usual number of limbs and heads.  It will come wrapped:


<blockquote>"It may be packed in leaves, wrapped in an odd length of fabric, a placemat, yards and yards and yards of string, joss paperï¿½you just never know, and it wonï¿½t be the same twice."</blockquote>


I think this is brilliant and weird, and I want to get Lockrey a subscription for her birthday, but don't tell her.

And finally on the toy frontier I have an (untested since I'm still at work and not on the bus) [link to a movie](http://www.mekhaye.net/mekhaye/images/tigger.wmv) of the animatronic Tigger doll (we have two at home) in a rather explicit scene with a Tickle Me Elmo doll.  I'm sure you can picture it, I sure can.  The original [article from Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/25/tigger_boning_tickle.html) has a still shot.

Again, you should just read Boing Boing, since this blog is over 80% Boing anyway.  Those guys rock.

* Update, I had the Toddlerpede link busted, it works better now.
