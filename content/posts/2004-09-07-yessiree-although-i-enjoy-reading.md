Yessiree. Although I enjoy reading the Vallentyne blog on work time, I haven't got the time (read: "nerve") to post to it from behind the firewall. So, I figured I'd use Jim's computer.  Now, I know what you're thinking. Why would I jeopardize the brand new system of my beloved when I won't risk doing that to a big faceless corporation?  Yeah. That's a poser. I guess it's because I doubt my innocent post can really do any damage, and Jim will love me anyway, whereas BigCo will dock my pay and make me wear the IT Dunce Cap for the day. (Jeez, if they don't have those they should eh? Wouldn't you like to give them out to the people who still are dumb enough to open executables attached to emails from people they don't know?)

Anyway, I'm pretty sure this computer is well-protected now, too, since that time that Darcy broke critical mass with spyware from his online gaming and other unknown but highly suspect activities and put the PC out of commission for a few weeks. Ah...roommates.

Speaking of which, have you had a chance to meet the new roommate at 26 Nairn? HELL-o. It's a good thing I'm too old and cranky to really give a shit that she makes me look like shrivelled old boot.
