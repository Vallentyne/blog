Nikki forgot to mention that she also is responsible for my demands.

I thought I would say it before someone else did.

Wow, holy blog time on Nikki!  She has been keeping up the chatter during my hiatus, that's for sure (I wasn't really on hiatus).  In the 10 days since I last posted she has put me to shame.

And of course she has now stolen all of my thunder.  There's nothing left to talk about.  She has said it all.  Yep.

**Or has she?**

oh, she has.  I didn't see that part.

curses.
