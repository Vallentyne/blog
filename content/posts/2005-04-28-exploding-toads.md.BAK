Well, now [this is obviously a sign](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/28/exploding_german_toads/) of our impending doom.

Apparently there is a certain pond in Hamburg, Germany now known as the "pond of death".  Ooohhh.  Scary.  Anyway, apparently the toads that live in this pond are subject to an unfortunate habit, they apparently swell in size, monstrously large, and then explode violently.  It's sure not much fun for the toads, that is clear.  The local authorities have posted a biologist there during the "witching hour" of 2-3am, where toad explosions reach their peak frequency.  During this hour, the sound of toads exploding echoes around the pond, sounding much like fireworks or gunfire, or popcorn in the microwave, or a 9 year old with bubblewrap, or.... well you get the idea.

This horrific mystery was unexplained until someone apparently discovered that crows were pecking at the toads and poking holes in them.  They were inflating themselves in their normal defense way, and apparently they couldn't stop inflating themselves because the crows had perforated their lungs... and that's about the end of them.

Certainly toads that spontaneously explode are a harbinger of our fate on this planet, but I guess this rather mundane explanation means that our catastrophic end at the hands of mother nature has to wait for a little longer.  Yes, I imagine that my last sight will be  Wilson's smug face nodding at me as the [walking octopi, running bats](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/03/to_use_what_may.html), and exploding toads slowly encircle me.
