You know how in the winter, usually sometime around the end of January your body finally squeezes the last tiny bit of Vitamin D from the tube on the shelf, swigs down the last drop of seratonin and says; yep guess what, you  now [feel like crap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder) because there is no hope and you are living in a hole into which no light and warmth shall ever enter, despair and tremble?Â  Yeah, well normally that happens only in January when we are locked into the deep freeze, but this year we are unusually fortunate to be able to experience that twice.

This summer seems to be incredibly wet and dreary, [The Weather Network](http://www.theweathernetwork.com/index.php?product=historical&placecode=caon0512) confirms that we have had 20mm more rain since July 1 than we normally get for the whole month, and twice as much rain as we had last year in the same period.Â  You only have to look at the forecast to know it's not going to get much better.

So, instead of a frozen benighted popsicle landscape we get to experience the soggy dripping mugginess of a good old English summer.Â  It's as if the whole city is parked in a car wash with the windows down, chugging bottled water, while wearing jeans with a running garden hose stuffed into the pocket.Â  I'm not one to let my environment affect my mood, but this is getting a little ridiculous.Â  My fingers are wrinkled _all of the time_ here people.

Does anyone remember what the sun looks like?

** Update:

Ok, so I may have been bitching a bit more than necessary, and my mood has been improved tremendously by this weekend's sunny weather.Â  I will say that this post was slightly prescient given the tremendous rainstorm we got on Friday.Â  Here's a rainy shot of the intersection near my house on Friday.Â  Needless to say, folks were avoiding the geyser...

No more weather talk, I promise!
