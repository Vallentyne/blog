In a return to a much-loved topic here, I thought I would post a link to a little article.  It's at [Wired.com](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,62871,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4) and the basic thrust is that file sharing has little to no effect on CD sales.  Of course, the recording industry is quick to say that the report is crap.  From their perspective, what else could possibly account for the decline in CD sales?

The title of the article is "Maybe the Music's Just Lousy?".  By jove, I think they might be on to something.

I know I'm firmly now out of the target demographic for music sales with a wife and three kids, but still I can say that there are so very few compelling songs on the radio that I **must **have, it's no bloody wonder they can't sell CDs.

Ali had some [eloquent thoughts ](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.htm#200056156)on this once, right here on the very blog.  A good comment on downloading music.
