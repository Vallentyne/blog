[Wilson](http://robertwilsonphoto.com) is a big [Ask A Ninja](http://www.askaninja.com) fan.  He wrote me today to make sure I watched the newest episode:



<blockquote>"I particularly like the most recent clip. It's got a little bit of everything, even a Bon Jovi reference (see if you can spot it)"</blockquote>



Kind of like an Easter Egg hunt, except that when you find an egg the bunny kills you.  One thing I have noticed, is the Ninja sort of getting a little, well, portly?  Maybe it's my imagination, and whatever you do, don't tell him.

Anyway, see for yourself.
