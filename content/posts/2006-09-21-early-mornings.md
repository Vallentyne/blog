This morning Nikki had what was hopefully the last of a series of dental "events" to endure.  As a result we had to have the whole family downtown for 7am.  I myself had the pleasure of waking 3 children about an hour and a half or so earlier than they are accustomed to waking.  That was not the most popular thing to do, as you can imagine.  I say I took great pleasure because I definitely enjoyed bouncing the kids out of their beds instead of the usual role reversal.Â  It was very sweet...

Jordy was first:


<blockquote>

Jordy: Why is it so dark?

me: We have to take Mom to the dentist.

Jordy: I don't want to go.

me: (cackling with glee) You have to, there's nobody else here to watch you.

Jordy: Get Nana J... (her words trailed off and she slumped back down onto her pillow)</blockquote>

Then Quinn:


<blockquote>

> 
> <blockquote>me: Time to wake up Quinn.

Quinn: I'm not waking up until you turn that off (waving pale pipe cleaner sized arm randomly at the light overhead)

me: You have to get up buddy.

Quinn: I'm not getting up until the earlies are all gone.</blockquote>
>

Finally Cael:


<blockquote>

> 
> <blockquote>me: Time to wake up.

Cael: (instantly sits up with huge unblinking blue eyes the size of sunny side egg yolks) Can I have breakfast?

me: Yep let's get you some.

Cael: (quietly, almost solemnly) yippee.</blockquote>
>

</blockquote>


Then after I had the boys dressed, they were standing at the top of the stairs looking down into the still very dark ground floor.


<blockquote>

> 
> <blockquote>Cael: Is it bedtime?

Quinn: No it's morningtime.

Cael:  It's still bedtime downstairs....  Dad is it bedtime down there?</blockquote>
> 
> 
</blockquote>


So there you have it.Â  By the time we got Mom taken to the dentist and then got back home and had some breakfast, everybody was ready to go back to bed, including me, and it wasn't even 8am.Â  Nikki came through her dentistry with flying colours, by the way.Â  I am going to make a point of mentioning to the kids that she slept most of the day away...Â  I think they will like that.
