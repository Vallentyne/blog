Amazing [video from inside a tornado](http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0506/feature6/multimedia.html) on the National Geographic site.  They used ground-placed probes with a bunch of cameras to capture all sides, and got lucky with a direct hit from a tornado, I'm not sure how big it was but it was definitely scary to see.  Those guys are nuts.

Worth taking the time to watch, for sure.
