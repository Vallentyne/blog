I'm conflicted by my desire for these undeniably [nerdy T-shirts](http://www.cultclassicts.com/cgi-bin/shirt.cgi/3616005339/cultclassicts/394829) with excellent quotes from Office Space.  On one hand, there's no surer way to label yourself a complete nerd than wearing a (relatively) obscure and sarcastic quote from a movie in order to prove that I am indeed much smarterer than everyone else.  On the other hand, they have some of the best friggin quotes from that movie...  

["I might be showing her my O-Face"](http://www.cultclassicts.com/cgi-bin/shirt.cgi/3616005339/cultclassicts/662679)

[No-Talent A** Clown](http://www.cultclassicts.com/cgi-bin/shirt.cgi/3616005339/cultclassicts/1149838)

etc.

So, there you go.  I saw this [here](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006736.html).
