A Japanese company has [announced a robotic suit](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2008/10/07/7001616-ap.html) that will assist elderly people who can't walk easily by themselves. Â The technology is very cool, it reads the brainwaves that are traveling to the legs and sort of amplifies them and assists motion with the robotic legs. Â It's amazing technology that will surely change millions of lives.

Hm.

Yes, millions of lives will be changed. Â The only problem I have is the absolute nards it takes to call a computer that is supposed to assist people HAL. Â Yes, you may recall the [HAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) that kills everybody in that little movie (not to mention another [unfortunate coincidence](http://www.google.ca/url?q=/finance%3Fclient%3Dob%26q%3DNYSE:HAL&sa=X&oi=stock&ct=title&usg=AFQjCNFDFehKEO_4yNRBLs6BSepie6h85A)) ? Â Why on earth would a company name it's product HAL? Â Unless, they have something to hide? Â Yes, methinks they do, because the company is called Cyberdyne. Â Yes, that's the same name as the [company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdyne_Systems) from [Terminator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator), the one that invented the sentient computer system that rises up and kills all of the humans. Â 

**W. Â T. Â F. ?**

Does it need to be any clearer for you people? Â Let's recap: Â Cyberdyne (evil company who will destroy us all) makes a set of robotic legs (and even admits a whole body suit is coming. Â Oh, it's coming all right.) that READS YOUR MIND and knows what you want to do, serendipitously called HAL (evil homicidal computer). Â The product is targeted at old people (who hate the rest of us able bodied people for, well, being able bodied and who are easily suggestible) and they will lead the robotic uprising against us all. Â It's the perfect storm of technology, capitalism, arthritis, and extraordinary cockiness and karmic taunting. Â We deserve what we get, unless we can somehow stop the slowly tottering army of old farts in their PJs waving sticks and dragging shawls behind them.
