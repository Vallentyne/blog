Our dual dog existence continues, and I'm sure that posts about Lloyd will diminish over time, so don't worry if this stuff bores you to tears.

We have been weighing him pretty regularly, mostly out of a sick fascination with how unbelievably fast he is growing.Â  He has more or less gained about 10 pounds in 14 days, which is a frightening rate, but not that surprising, considering that we feed him 50% more food per day than Harvey...

Of course the inevitable result of all that food, as most of you are smugly nodding to yourselves, is poop.Â  Lots of poop.Â  I have been thinking about what I should be doing with all of this poop, and while flinging it into the park beside us at night is both fun and appealing, I think I should come up with something else.

I saw [this solution on Boing Boing](http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2009/04/10/how-to-make-a-minpin.html), but to be honest her dogs are laughably small when compared to ours, so I think I will be doing [something like this](http://www.ehow.com/how_2159337_design-septic-system-dog-shelter.html), which was linked to from the comments on that article.Â  Dig a hole to fit the top half of a bucket, throw the poop in with some septic starter and keep it wet.Â  When that gets full, pull the bucket out and dig another hole.Â  Brilliant and simple, and it's got to be better than throwing plastic bags of poop out in the trash.

Don't laugh, but I'm thinking I will be using a 45 gallon garbage can for this purpose...Â  If I can get a year out of that, well then I will call it a win.Â  Yikes.

This is the first time I have ever owned two dogs, so some things are unmarked territory here (that's a dog pee pun), but has anyone else ever witnessed the synchronized pooping phenomenon?Â  It's a bit strange, but it really happens.
