Here's [a pretty funny writeup](http://slate.msn.com/id/2102940/fr/rss/) about a hot dog ad that sounds really disgusting to my mind.




The gist of it is that the ad links hot dogs to, well, genitalia.  Why on earth would a hot dog company put out an ad that did that?  And the overuse of the word "girthy".




Disturbing.
