Well, as I mentioned before I like to stay away from the "hot political topic" but here's one I couldn't pass up.

According to [this story](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1369643,00.html?=rss), good old Dubya is busily "protecting" people by working on some legislature to suppress pro-homosexual drama. The law is targeted at books and plays, and not obscure ones; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Color Purple and A Chorus Line are mentioned specifically as being subject to the ban.  Here's a quote from the article, describing a dialog between the author and one of Bush's supporters doing the work on this legislature


<blockquote>"Traditional family values are under attack," Allen informs me. They've been under attack "for the last 40 years". The enemy, this time, is not al-Qaida. The axis of evil is "Hollywood, the music industry". We have an obligation to "save society from moral destruction". We have to prevent liberal libarians and trendy teachers from "re-engineering society's fabric in the minds of our children". We have to "protect Alabamians"</blockquote>


Yikes. The article goes on to challenge "Allen" on Shakespearean literature, which was of course performed by all male casts originally.


<blockquote>Would Allen's bill cut off state funding for Shakespeare?

"Well," he begins, after a pause, "the current draft of the bill does not address how that is going to be handled. I expect details like that to be worked out at the committee stage. Literature like Shakespeare and Hammet [sic] could be left alone." Could be. Not "would be".</blockquote>


Ahh, let's elect guys like this to public office.  Oh wait, they already did.  Crap.

Protect Alabamians, like jeez.
