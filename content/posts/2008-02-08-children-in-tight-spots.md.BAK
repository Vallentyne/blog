Well things like thisÂ are bound to happen eventually with two young boys.Â  Yesterday Quinn and Cael were leaving karate at the Kanata Rec Centre with Nikki and they were goofing off and went around the corner to the elevator.Â  Nikki was putting her coat on and had her back turned, so they managed to get the doors open and they went in.Â  When the doors started to close Quinn put his hand in between them and got pinched pretty hard.Â  The doors weren't opening back up again and Nikki was trying to tell Quinn to push all of the buttons, but he was crying too hard.Â  Needless to say the doors finally opened and Nikki rescued the two (now very subdued) boys.Â  All is well, he is just a little bit bruised, but they probably will always remember when they got stuck in an elevator.Â  It's these little lessons that will define their actions later.Â  Nikki asked Quinn what the lesson was that he learned and he tearfully said "To wait."Â  Not a bad thing to remember, generally.

On that same note, [here's a story](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/02/05/4828541-ap.html) about a lad who is very likely in the same boat, but maybe to larger degree.Â  A four year old boy crawled into his parent's washing machine and managed to get wedged in between the agitator and the side with one knee jammed against his chest.Â  All efforts to free him failed, including firefighters taking the washer apart.Â  So, out come the jaws of life to cut the washer apart and free the boy.Â  He was fine, but I don't think the washer was the same after that one.
