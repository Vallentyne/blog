Oh man, I caught [this link](http://english.pravda.ru/photo/report/diving_tigers-1817/3/) on Metafilter and it's my new favourite picture. The most-est, ever.  I never knew that tigers could swim very well, let alone dive underwater.  I guess with the proper encouragement (raw steak) anything is possible.  Underwater they look even more like some kind of mythical beast, snarling and ferocious.  Which is what they are, really.  Amazing creatures.
