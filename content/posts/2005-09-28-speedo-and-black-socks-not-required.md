You know those old guys on the beach you see sometimes, the ones with the zinc oxide on their nose, the dangerously tight speedos (difficult to notice under the sunburnt belly), black socks, leather sandals, $2 hawaiian shirt, and straw hat?  You know, the ones with the metal detectors, looking for lost watches and stuff on the beach?

Yeah, well laugh it up, sister 'cause one of those guys just struck it rich, in a big way [to the tune of $10 billion-with-a-freaking-b](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8054&feedId=online-news_rss20).  Well, I actually have no idea what these guys look like, and to be honest they didn't use one of those metal detectors, and it wasn't at the beach, and they may not have been wearing speedos... but you get the idea here, ok?  They really struck it rich.

They used a robot with some ground penetrating radar and other tools to locate this [buried treasure](http://www.melfisher.com/salvage/go/1715stor.asp) on Robinson Crusoe island (didn't know there was one, did you? neither did I).  

Wow.  
Man.  

Those nerds are really rich.
