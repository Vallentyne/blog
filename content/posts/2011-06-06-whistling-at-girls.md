As I was running on the weekend, trying to get ready to run my first actual [honest to goodness race](http://www.runottawaclub.ca/events/calendar/28th-annual-canada-day-road-races/) (more on that later), I overtook a pair of older ladies on the path who were doing this Nordic Walking thing (which I haven't quite figured out just yet).Â  They were passed by a couple of bikes just ahead of me, who lawfully rang their bells to warn the ladies before they were overtaken.Â  As I passed the girls however I startled one of them as I jogged past.Â  She remarked that I didn't have a bell, and I said no I don't and apologized for startling her.Â  As I kept jogging I mentioned that I could always whistle, but then againÂ that would be rude.Â  Her response?

"No. That would be nice!"

I laughed for the next 3km.Â  I still think that whistling at ladies wielding sticks is probably not a good plan.Â  Nikki concurs.

On the [Nordic Walking](http://nordicwalkfit.com/Default.aspx) front, if you haven't heard of this yet you clearly haven't been outside anywhere in the last three years.Â  To the untrained eye, let me describe it for you:Â  It's basically walking.Â  Holding ski poles.Â  That's it as far as I can see.Â  There must be more to it however, since you can become a certified Nordic Walker, which must involve more than just walking around holding things.Â  If that were a sound path to physical fitness my own sport of Bavarian Lurching would be much more popular.Â  It involves attending summer outdoor concerts with a plastic cup of beer in each hand.Â  You have to slosh the beer onto everyone else's shoes without getting a drop of it on your own.Â  Very tricky.Â

The actual, real sport of Nordic WalkingÂ seems to be incredibly popular though, so I will now stop making fun of it.Â  It only makes sense since the people I make fun of probably already own two things with which to beat me and/or skewer me. Â And they might be in good shape.Â  Â That's just too dangerous.
