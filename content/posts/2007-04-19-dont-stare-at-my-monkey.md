This just in:Â  Zoo officials have imprisoned a chimp named Cheetah in Antwerp who is so devilishly charismatic they warn visitors to not [look him in the eye](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/18/chimp.belgium.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories), lest they fall under his spell.Â  What kind of magnificent chimp must he be?Â  I mean that must be one seriously persuasive chimpanzee, because I never found them to be all that compelling.Â Â  Comical, certainly, but I've never had any trouble avoiding eye contact with a chimp on roller skates or smoking a cigar.

Truly amazing that they have managed to capture this phenomenal animal.
