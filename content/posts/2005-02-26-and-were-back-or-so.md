...And we're back.

Or so I think.  We have had some router problems here at home and have been completely off the air for most of the week.  It really hits me in the geek pride when that happens, but what can you do.  I went through 2 new routers trying to fix the problem when the first one went down, and even now the second one seems a little shaky.  Time will tell if we stay running.

Oh, if you sent us mail recently, I would resend it if it was important, 'cause we didn't get it.
