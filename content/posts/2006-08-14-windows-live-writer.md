This is a quick test post of the [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) blogging software. It's not too bad, really. It let's you post in a window that looks like your blog, instead of the usual Movable Type plain text window. Let's see if this makes it to the blog....

The problem would be (as it always is with an installed client) when I'm not at my own computer I would just end up going back to the Movable Type interface anyway to post something. The insert picture business is alright I guess, but I make Flickr pay for my image bandwidth, so why bother? Anyway, it is a clean application, and it should certainly stay free in it's current incarnation. No way this is worth any money yet.

Another annoyance is the new post=new window behaviour, I can't for the life of me get the current window to just reuse when I am done with a post. I think that pretty much kills it for me, I don't generally work on more than one post at a time.
