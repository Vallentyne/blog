This morning my phone was acting a bit strangely, I couldn't delete some messages from Hootsuite for some reason.Â  I opened up the laptop to see what was really in my inbox and it seems that they messed up large today.Â  Hundreds and hundreds of messages sent with their subscriber addresses in the clear for all to see in the To: line.Â  A mistake, obviously but the added bit is the message is a reminder that "your 60 day trial is expiring" and to sign up soon.Â  Methinks that most of these people won't be signing up anytime soon.

Myself included.

800 messages and counting......
