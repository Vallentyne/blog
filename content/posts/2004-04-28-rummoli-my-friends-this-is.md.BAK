[Rummoli.](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9794)

My friends, this is truly a game of kings.  Delightfully engaging to the novice, but subtle and mysterious when you get into it.    Minutes to learn, 10 more minutes to master.  Just ask Wilson's alter-ego, Rummolio Grabanickel.  Rummoli can be addictive, and he has seen the dark underbelly of the rummoli world only too well.

Here's hoping that one day, you will finally hit the fabled 7-8-9 or King-Ace of diamonds combo and be free of that nickel-laden monkey on your back.

Good luck, brother.
