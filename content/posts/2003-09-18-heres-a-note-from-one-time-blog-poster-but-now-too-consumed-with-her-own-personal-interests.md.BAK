Here's a note from one-time-blog-poster-but-now-too-consumed-with-her-own-personal-interests Ali:

****************
Tomorrow, my friends, is international Talk Like a Pirate day:

[http://www.talklikeapirate.com/](http://www.talklikeapirate.com/)

Are ya ready, kids??
****************

Ah yes.

At one time this topic would have made for jolly blog banter.  Now it's just dribbling through email inboxes like yesterday's grog in the privy.

Sighh.

Arrh, I don't know what I'm doin'.

But, one guy that does know what he's doin' is the director of Trailer Park Boys, Mike Clattenburg.  I recently received the 1st and 2nd season DVD collection and Nikki and I have been going through some of the special features and they are absolutely hilarious.  There aren't many, but the ones that are included are excellent.  A lot of focus on J-Roc and Ricky, which is all good.  We also watched one of the episodes that has a commentary by Mike Clattenburg and it's really interesting to hear what he has to say.  For instance, Ricky (Rob Wells) actually owns Lahey's car in real life.

Anyway, I'm sure some of you will be subjected to watching it at our place soon enough, but I think it's excellent.

Later.
