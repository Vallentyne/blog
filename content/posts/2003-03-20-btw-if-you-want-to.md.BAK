Btw, if you want to use the upload File button (to post pictures to the blog) be sure to understand what the options are there.  When you upload something the upload path should be images, just like that no quotes or backslashes.  That way they get placed into the right spot.  Then it will ask you if you want the picture inline, or if it should just be a link.  Use inline if you want everybody to see the picture without having to click on a link.  I would suggest that anything larger than about 150K **should **be a link, or it will get a bit (more) boggy loading up.

Anyway, have at it.
