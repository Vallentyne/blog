Just caught this article on Cnet about iPods being the scourge of IT security everywhere.  What a load of crap.

This sounds like a security consultant screaming for attention to me.  Mention iPods in the press and you're good for some attention.  He wrote software to assist in this data stealing, what amounts to a "batch file".  Ohhh.  Here's a hint, if your employee has access to data, he can usually steal it in any number of ways.  Printing, email attachments, other electronic methods (http, ftp, etc etc), even screenshots if necessary.  What the hell does an iPod have to do with it?  It's efficient, to be sure, but the risk is the same as the other methods.  There's no indication in the article how the spy-pod magically gets access to data that the logged-in user doesn't already have access to.  The bottom line is; if you don't trust someone with your secrets, they shouldn't have access to them.  

This problem has existed since computers had floppy drives, and before that when someone who got into your office could *gasp!* take papers right off your desk.  Physical access is the whole tamale, it always has been and most corporate offices don't really worry enough about that, BUT don't expect any security measures to protect you from having people steal the very data they work with everyday.  It's just silly.
