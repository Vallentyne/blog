Nice. The Vallentynes are all about the "new colours", huh? Very sharp.

On other topics, it is T-minus 6 days until the TPB party, people. Have you got your duds yet? Andrea, are you guys going to be home for Easter? If so, get yourself and your hubby over here on Sunday night for the Season Three Premiere. Last night was the TPB marathon. Did you guys catch any? I watched about 5 episodes while I made lists and giggled at some of my party ideas. Awwww YEah! As usual, minor pre-party construction and renovations will be undertaken...
