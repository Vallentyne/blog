It's been two weeks since I posted about the family news, thought I should catch you up to date.  I must be careful though.  There's a reason why there hasn't been much news, which I will get into in a minute.

First off, Jordy has been downright althletic lately.  She is trying out for the cross country team at school and they have been running three mornings a week for a couple of weeks now.  Good for her, I  say.  I tried out for the cross country team in high school (nevermind I'm an asthmatic geek who couldn't run to math class without my inhaler) and got lost in the Grove in the Prior.  I wandered out 30 minutes after the last runner.  Needless to say I didn't make it, but I think Jordy may have some actual endurance so she just might do it.  Way to go Jordy.

Quinn has discovered the world of language.  It is without a hint of fatherly pride that I say he is a genius.  Ok, there may be hint in there.  But he is talking.  A lot.  And getting better at it every day.  He enjoys talking on the phone, as some of you can attest.  Whit tells me he would kick some kindergartners butts right now with his letter and number skills.  Potty training is now being influenced by Dr. Phil, so I'm not sure where we are on that one, maybe Nikki could post on that topic.

I have to wrap up quickly because my time is running short.  We have another child as you may know.  Cael's growth has taken a turn for the strange.  About two weeks ago he started to refuse to wear clothes.  We didn't mind that initially, but then his hair started to grow wild and he became increasingly hard to calm down, he turned wild.  He has become too quick for us to catch and is now living in the furnace ducts in the house.  He roams the house at will, appearing when you least expect it.  He seems to survive on Harvey's dog food in the basement, Harvey is too scared to fight him for it, after all they weigh the same.  I have only seen him once in the last week, just for a minute.  I had the digital camera and took a snapshot of him.  It's quite the sight really, it's not every day you see a feral child.  He got away, I only ended up with a slight bite on the ankle, but you can see the ferocity of the attack.

He's going to be on Fox next week, "When Huge Babies Attack!", or "Huge Slow Baby, Even Slower Donuts".
