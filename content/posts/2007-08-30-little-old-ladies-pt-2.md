Another installment in an [unintentional series of posts](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/08/23/a-bad-week-for-little-old-ladies/) about little old ladies, this time a 79 year old woman was sleeping at her home when two men broke in and were rummaging through her stuff.Â  She grabbed her cane, and [chased them off](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/29/4455475-cp.html).Â  The thieves got away with nothing.Â  That's one formidable woman, methinks.
