One note of interest is there are now 1 year's worth of archives now for the blog.  Check 'em out for some fun reading.  Here's [a good bit](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.htm) from a ways back.  (Note: if you are actually reading this blog's archives you can be quite sure that you are BORED.  Or medicated.)

One year ago almost to the day we first posted about making the rink, isn't that a funny strange thing?  It might have something to do with the fact that we always seem to try making a backyard skating rink in the winter, and not the summer, but you still have to admit it has a weird sort of karmic coolness, don't you think?
