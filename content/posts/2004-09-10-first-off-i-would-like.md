First off, I would like to mention to Andrea that I also did not mention the Saturday night hockey watching that we had going on the night before the Murray clan came over. So, you can either feel much better or equally slighted, it's up to you. :-) Actually, I should have thought you would rather I said nothing after Cael was caught staring at your daughter's butt. On film no less.

It's shameful, and I wouldn't have said a thing, but it's better to talk about these things I guess.

But on another completely different topic, I have played paintball before, and I must say there are times when I thought [something like this](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/ebay-paintball-gatling-gun-021110.php) would have been a really good idea. It's a paintball gatling gun for sale on eBay. It's only $14 000, and I think it's a steal. It must be the latent redneck in me, but I just can't help but think this thing rocks. What do you say Kyle, halvesies?
