I had a great time away despite the evil Be-atch that screwed Court's well laid plans.  Turns out the hotel they were replaced by was nothing short of swank and just plain awesome.

I tend to be a little defensive when it comes to my loved ones, and perhaps not as subtle as my conservative husband.  It is for this reason that I present you all with this....

Ah, sweet vindication.
