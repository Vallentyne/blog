A nice little follow up to my glowing review of They Might Be Giants' new CD [Here Comes Science](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/09/10/they-might-be-giants-here-comes-science/) on Time.com.Â  It's cool to see pro-science folks do well by not dumbing things down, contrary to the norm.Â  Those songs are still favourites around the house, I will often put it on while we are having dinner and the whole family bops along and sings the words.Â  Actually Cael usually also acts out the words, which has to be seen to be believed.

Anyway, it's way cool stuff.Â  Check these guys out.

Special bonus, which I didn't know is: they did the theme songs for Malcolm in the Middle, and The Daily Show.Â  Cool.
