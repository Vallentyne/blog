As I wake up on a picture perfect spring day, skip outside without a coat and bathe in the beautiful sunlight, it behooves us to remember that we exist here because nature tolerates us, and sometimes are subject to her moods and tempers.

The [unexpected eruption](http://www.patagoniatimes.cl/content/view/485/1/) of a volcano in Chile is certainly one such mood, it seems.Â  That is definitely scary enough, but check out what happened when a thunderstorm [collided with the plume of ash](http://megagalerias.terra.cl/galerias/index.cfm?id_galeria=30734).Â  Absolutely breathtaking, and it drives the point home that for all our fancy intellect and technology, we could be wiped off the earth if we make her mad enough.
