Well summer is looming, and the kids are getting primed for the holidays.Â  It should be a good one this year, the lads are older than ever of course and so it will be easier than ever to do stuff.Â  I thought a quick wrap up of recent family happenings would be a good idea, if anyone cares to read it.

Quinn finally decided that it was time to part with both of his front teeth, in two days no less.Â  Needless to say the tooth fairy came by, twice.Â  So now he's gappy at the front, and probably cuter than ever.

Jordy is pushing hard to finish her school year strong.Â  She has improved quite a bit from last term, so we are all optimistic about her final marks.Â  Good job Jordy.Â  She is also scheduling the busiest summer ever, with babysitting jobs and fun stuff packed in.Â  The job is more or less a prerequisiste since she now wants to save her money and buy a laptop.Â  Apparently the hardware provided at the Vallentyne household isn't quite up to snuff for her tastes...Â  Maybe I should take offense at that, but I can't seem to do it.

Cael still wants to be a superhero and is spending his time "working on his muscles".Â  His growth is ever so slightly slowing it seems since he had a doctor's appointment the other day and the doctor was actually able to plot his height/weight on a normal growth chart.Â  He is in the 95th percentile, but that's actually an improvement because it's the first time since he was born that he has even been on the chart.Â  I wish I was joking.

Some quick Cael quotes:


Cael upon meeting Rod's kids Alex and Noah, he couldn't understand why they don't have a sister and kept asking where she was, everybody has a sister, why don't they?





Nikki was pushing Cael on the swing, and getting quite high.Â  Cael said "It feels like my bones are at swimming lessons."Â  I think we all know exactly the feeling he was describing.


Finally, I thought I would let you in a little on what happens in our bedroom.Â  Yes, it's a bit personal, but I trust you won't tell anybody.Â  From the pageviews this blog gets, I know our secret will be very very safe.Â  As I am falling asleep, over the years I have developed a tendency to sort of thrash and jump just a little bit.Â  A tiny bit.Â  Just a wee bit.Â  I have, at times, accidentally clobbered Nikki with a misplaced elbow or hand.Â  Abolutely, purely accidental.Â  Of course over time this has resulted in a change to our sleeping positions.Â  Now my flailing limbs are no longer welcome on Nikki's side of the bed, so instead I keep to my side mostly.Â  Except for Tuesday evening for some reason.

We were drifting off to sleep as usual, except that Nikki was facing me instead of laying on her other side.Â  I guess I fell asleep because the next thing I knew I was aware of a sharp pain on my forehead, even before my eyes opened.Â  When I opened them I could see Nikki glaring at me with squinty, sleepy eyes. "We cracked heads!" she croaked.Â  I mumbled something about being sorry and then we rolled over and went back to sleep.Â  The whole exchange took maybe 5 seconds.

The only thing that saved my butt was that she couldn't remember a thing about it the next morning.Â  I thought I was dead for sure.Â  Probably brain damage saved my life.
