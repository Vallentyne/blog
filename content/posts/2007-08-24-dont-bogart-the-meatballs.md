Oh lordy.

Apparently the wife of a NY detective wasn't too kicked about his choice of profession, so she spiked his [meatballs with marijuana](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/24/4442568-ap.html) before his drug test.Â  He rather predictably failed the test.Â  He was then kicked out of the force, and I guess she owned up to doing it.

That should make for some nice friendly dinner conversations now, eh?

Seriously, there's no point in going anywhere but the Weird News section of the Canoe.ca site for this kind of stuff, it seems that's my primary source of blog stuff lately.
