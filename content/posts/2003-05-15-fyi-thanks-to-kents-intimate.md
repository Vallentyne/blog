fyi, thanks to Kent's intimate knowledge of TV schedules, Showcase runs current TPB episodes, but 2 weeks behind the latest ones on Thursdays at 9:30pm.  This means that I can finally watch this season's 2nd episode, and then hopefully catch up on Sunday's episode at the same time.  Way cool, especially when you want these suckers on tape.

Unless you buy the DVD....

that will be all.
