Recently Quinn had an assignment at school to write a persuasive letter to his teacher in an attempt to get her to not assign him any homework.Â  I think he did a fantastic job, and I asked him if he minded if I posted it here.Â  He said that was fine, so have a read and see if you agree with me.


<blockquote>Dear Mrs. Teacher (not his real teacher's name...)

Am I a good student (at least the majority of times)?Â  Why do I need homework?Â  I want no homework for a month and I will tell you why.

If you keep on giving us homework (not just me) the class will have less opportunities to spend time with their friends and families.Â  We need breaks sometimes, and my only break is home and you're filling it with work!Â  I don't know a person who works non-stop without breaks and if you do, that's bad company.Â  It's affective on our health and strength too.Â  If I'm trapped in my home day and night, I'm not getting the vitamins and minerals I need.Â  We also won't get enough sleep which will affect out marks and learning goals.Â  You're not only hurting us, but yourself too!Â  Of you keep on giving us this "Christmas present" you'll have to correct it, which steals time with your daughter who's only 1!Â  She'd be so depressed.Â  You wouldn't want that, right?

Another reason we shouldn't have this nightmare is it will affect our health and growth and as a gym teacher, that's unacceptable on your part.Â  If we had less homework, we would be big muscular beach bodies.Â  We would be a ton more healthy and fit!Â  Also, to enjoy the outdoors we need trees!Â  If we didn't have trees where would weÂ  be?Â  And now your walking around with deadly axes, killing every tree in sight.Â  If I were Prime Minister, I would put a stop to the endless torture to these young citizens!Â  What did they do to you?Â  We would also be less stressed, you would be too.Â  Why is our class so loud and annoying?Â  IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!!!Â  And like I said before, What's more important?Â  Homework or <your daughter>?Â  I thought so!

We also already work hard.Â  Why do we need homework?Â  Think about our portfolios.Â  They are huge (at least MY portfolio).Â  That's all the work we did at school.Â  Multiply that by five.Â  That's how much homework.Â  Think about WWW.Â  Think about math sheets.Â  How you never correct it.Â  Again, that's why it's all your fault!Â  Also, the second reason, Mme French Teacher is flaming red is because homework keeps me from focusing on French.Â  If you think different I might change my mind about my favourite subject (mathematics) to Medieval Times.Â  That's not good.

That is why the class (or at least me) deserves a break.Â  Besides, wouldn't you like to see 28 faces beaming up at you?Â  Mind the frown.</blockquote>


Needless to say, he got a great mark.Â  No word yet on if his letter will be successful or not, but I will update you later.

Btw, I asked him about his last sentence and he responded that everyone in the class universally hates homework, with the exception of one single girl who loves it.Â  Hence, the frown.Â  What a kid.
