Our fridge at home is a busy place, as you can imagine.  Five humans (and periodically, a dog) eat the food that comes out of there every day.  Most of the time we eat that sucker empty in no time flat, descending like a swarm of locusts.  From time to time something slips through the cracks and we don't get to it until neither Nikki nor I can be sure when it was purchased, and so it's either roll the dice and give it a go (which we don't do very often), or toss it in the trash.  Well, those days are soon to be numbered it seems.

Enter [Timestrip Smart Labels](http://www.timestrip.com/home.html) to save us from ourselves.  It's too cool stuff, they are disposable strips that you activate and stick to stuff when you put it in the fridge.  The strips have a little window that shows you how much time has elapsed since you did that, so you can better decide if you should eat that potato salad, etc.  The only problem I can see is I'm not too crazy about the extra effort it will take to activate and adhere these things to all of the groceries we buy.  That and the extra cost of having these things on hand might be a problem for the business model.  Still, there are some indications on the website that some products may start to come with these things built right into the packaging, and that would make much more sense.

I saw this one on [Gizmodo.com](http://Gizmodo.com)
