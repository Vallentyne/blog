I have been spending some time on the Ottawa Citizen [bus strike site](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/getting-there/index.html), reading the articles about the strike vote today.Â  What's most interesting are the comments left [here](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Business/Soundoff+will+strike/1143599/story.html) by regular folks.Â  There is hardly any support for the drivers, which is maybe not that surprising, but there is tons of direct support for the city council and mayor.

The comments can best be summarized as follows:



	  * The strikers would be smart to accept the offer, they have a good job and this is a recession after all.
	  * Most commenters expressed hope that the city would stand firm and out-wait the union because while the strike is bad, the consequences of giving in are likely increased taxes, and the drastic reduction in the city's ability to negotiate reasonable contracts with other unions.Â  Even lots of people who think the mayor is a jerk still support the city's position.
	  * The strike is severely affecting low-income earners who most fervently hope for a quick end to it all, whatever the method.
	  * Deep resentment towards the bus drivers who are seen as greedy, short-sighted, and selfish.Â  Many commenters are swearing off public transit for good, refusing to be "held hostage again".Â  That's not good for the city or the bus drivers, for sure.Â  If this sentiment takes hold, those drivers will be out of work anyway since there won't be any demand.

It's rather inspiring really, because while some people are clearly hurting, public support for the city is very strong.Â  I'm morbidly certain that the union is going to reject the offer today, against all better judgment.

I think it's going to be a long strike, and if we are in it for the long haul, we might as well beat the union down and take back the scheduling.Â  There's no reason to go this long and then give in, as far as I can see.

It sucks to be a bus driver, that much is sure.Â  Even if they do accept the offer, their salary increases have probably been largely negated from the last 4 weeks on strike.Â  It will take them a long time to recoup the loss, I think.

**Update:Â  It seems they have [rejected the offer](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Transit+union+rejects+contract+offer/1156756/story.html), and now my friends things will get even weirder.
