Friday links.



	  * William Shatner has a [new album.](http://www.shatnerhasbeen.com/) Yes, that William Shatner, is there any other? Listen to "Common People" on the site, it's hilarious. I think that's a cover.
	  * [Motorized Rollerblades](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/motosk8-motorized-rollerblades-022415.php)  25mph, no brakes.  These are made for [guys who like luge](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/08/so-its-slow-day-here-at-work.htm), or [rocket-powered wheelchairs](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/08/i-know-i-shouldnt-find-this-funny-in.htm).
	  * [Credit-card sized shotgun](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/credit-card-sized-shotgun-022867.php) for discrete holdups.

All good stuff.
