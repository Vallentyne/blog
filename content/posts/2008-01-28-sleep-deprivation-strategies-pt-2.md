Well my [initial attempt at sleep deprivation](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/25/sleep-deprivation-strategies/) was much more ordinary than scientific.Â  Yep instead of carefully controlled naps, we instead went out for dinner with the Wilsons and (ahem) ended up requiring a taxi cab home that evening.Â  It was basically 4am by the time we went to bed.Â  I then woke up at 9:30am on Saturday.Â  By the time I went to bed Saturday evening at 11:00pm, that works out to 5.5 hours of sleep in 41 hours, so it's really only a little more sleep than I would have had anyway, it was just all at once instead of spaced out.Â  However, I resolve to try this again in a much more controlled and normal way, and without the disruptive influence of those damn Wilsons.Â 

My initial goal is to try to study for some upcoming work-related tests using the extra time this should give me.Â  Time will tell whether studying while depriving myself of sleep is really a good idea.Â 

Stay with me, dear reader.
