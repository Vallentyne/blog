Aw crap.

Apple just announced a mobile phone/iPod/smartphone that I suddenly have a deep abiding NEED to have.  What the hell is it about this company?  I also want one of their TV streaming devices.  I can't link to anything yet, the keynote speech is still going.
Sigh.   Sorry Nikki, there's a few hundred dollars I'm going to want to spend on toys.

Ok, here's an update now.Â  The Apple TV thing is [here](http://www.apple.com/appletv/), the iPhone is [here](http://www.apple.com/iphone).Â  Man, that's cool stuff.
