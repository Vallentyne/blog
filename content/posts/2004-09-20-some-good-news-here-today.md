Some good news here today, it's all stuff that's sure to enrich your life as usual.  I have standards to live up to, you know.

First, on the spoiled and pampered pet front; [a cell phone for your dog or cat](http://www.petsmobility.com/).  I got this from Techdirt, and it's basically a normal phone that just answers automatically so you can talk to your pet over the speakerphone.  GPS tracking system and fiber optic camera available separately.

And finally today, I can't decide if this is cruel or funny.  Or a hoax.  The premise of [this blog](http://ifoundsomeofyourlife.blogspot.com) is that someone left a memory card from their camera in a taxi in New York City.  There were 271 pictures on it, and the guy that found it is going to post them one at a time, one per day.  He will be writing captions for each one, making up a story as he goes.  As far as the author is concerned, nobody has claimed the pictures yet.  The captions are well written and funny, or the ones I saw anyway.
