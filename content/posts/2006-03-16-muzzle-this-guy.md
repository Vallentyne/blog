Good old Pat.  At his age, we would normally look the other way and call it "hardening of the arteries" or "the vapors" or "crazy old stick-shaking geezer syndrome".  It gets a little harder to ignore him though when he owns a television network, and he is continually aggravating religious tensions worldwide.

Anyway, his most recent comments are what can only be described as [inflamatory](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4805952.stm).

I have talked about him briefly [before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/thursdays.html).
