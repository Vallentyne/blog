Wilson sent around a link a few days ago to [The Meatrix](http://themeatrix.com) , which is a pretty funny send up on The Matrix.  As he says it has a good message too, about the dangers of industrial farming.  It is probably a little too real to think about, but really where the heck did I think all that meat came from?  I mean come on.

Anyway, not to completely steal Wilson's thunder without giving a little something back, I found [this link](http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20050305/food.asp).  It's a scientific report on the benefits of drinking beer if you also eat your meat well done.  Apparently the beer works to counteract the bad stuff you get when you over cook meat, dramatically reducing the bad stuff in fact.  So, there you go, yet another reason that God must love us because not only did he give us beer and meat, he made beer [completely useful](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/page1/3089334) and [meat plentiful](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/H/HOGZILLA?SITE=APWEB&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT), too.
