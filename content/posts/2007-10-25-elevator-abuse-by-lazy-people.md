Just a small observation.

I just love people who get on an elevator and go up or down one or two floors.Â  I especially love it when they have a "busy" demeanor.Â  Yep, you were so busy you couldn't walk up or down a flight of stairs.Â  Funny thing about stairs, they are always ready to go, no waiting required.Â  Even better are the people who are actually pissed off about how long the elevator took to show up.Â  I wish there was something that could be done about that.Â  The only thing I can really come up with is to hack the elevator software so it won't accept a destination within 2 floors of it's current location.Â  People could still ride the elevator to a destination one floor away, but they would need to ride it sufficiently far enough away first.Â  That ought to take their urgency down a notch or two (ha ha).Â  Seriously though, it's inefficient use of the elevator, it slows everyone else down, and it bothers the living crap out of me.Â  I never ever use it for short trips, and I wouldn't even use it to get to the 13th floor where I work except for some unknown reason all of the stairwell doors are locked from the outside at the ground level.Â  Why do that?Â  The elevators are public, there's no security there.Â  What makes the stairs so dangerous?Â  They want us fat and unhealthy, for some reason.Â  In fact when you think about it, why are stairwells so hard to find and use in general?Â  They are almost always hidden away somewhere and generally the ugliest part of an office building.Â  If they looked good, were easy to get to and use, wouldn't that make a lot more sense?Â  No electricity required, no moving parts to wear out, etc.Â  I know obviously some people can't use the stairs for medical reasons, but if more of us able-bodied folks used the stairs more often I'm betting that number would go down from the health benefits.Â  I have no research of any kind to back this up, nor am I qualified in any way to comment, but it feels right doesn't it?

Sorry for the rant folks.
