I just frigging love this story about a [72 year old woman who ran down a girl about 56 years younger than her](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4602626/Teenage-handbag-thief-outpaced-by-72-year-old-ex-sprinter.html) who had taken her purse.Â  Apparently she had asked a group of girls for directions to a theater, they hopped into her car to take her there, and one of the girls took off from the back seat with her purse.Â  It didn't hurt that the 72 year old was a champion sprinter in her youth.


<blockquote>"She had a head start but I covered 70 yards in about 15 seconds and was    within two strides of her when she looked over her shoulder and saw me.

"She probably thought I was an easy target but she shouldn't have judged    a book by its cover. The look on her face was one of sheer amazement and she    just threw my bag aside."</blockquote>


Not that I would want to discount her physical fitness, but maybe this is a sign of things to come?Â  If you take into account the increasingly unfit teenagers, and the increasingly fit old-timers, maybe they will make more of a match in a few years than we ever could have dreamed.Â  This is a good thing for those of us, ah, past our teenage years.Â  It will no longer be a big deal when I'm retired and at the mall in my plaid pants, white belt and paisley cardigan and I see a group of teenagers coming towards me.Â  Maybe by then they will be the ones to lumber aside as I glower at their flabby physiques.Â  That's right, sport.Â  You had better step back, or this geezer's gonna be up in your grill.

Well, maybe not.Â  Still, the picture they took of our 72 year old sprinter is frigging adorable, and you should click through to read about the scolding her daughter gave her.
