Heh heh, good one, although perhaps you're not the best person to make jokes when it comes to cycling, eh Robbi? My sources tell me that perhaps you were a wee, teensy-tiny bit winded when you tried to slip-stream behind the SuperCycle to downtown last week... Which reminds me, I meant to mention that I ran my first 10K on Saturday. 50 minutes isn't exactly blisteringly fast, but with my 20K-a-week run regime, I've got my body fat down to 15% (and for women, 12% is essential body fat). Yessiree, almost 33 and in the best shape of my life!

OK, enough of that, although Court's blog mission statement does say the site is for trash-talking... I'm actually quite impressed with both of you for biking to work. I haven't owned a bike in ages, but I well remember my last big outing, which was to bike to Gatineau Park from Sandy Hill and just about faint before the actual trail riding was about to begin...

Soooo... blog names, eh? On a TPB theme, you might try "Right, Randy" or "Watch the Carts!" or some such catch-phrase.  I'll keep thinking on it...
