This weekend we were lucky enough to be up at Cedar Cove for Father's Day.Â  We rented a trailer there for the weekend (it's the usual gig, we do it every year).Â  We were lucky enough this year that the forecasted rain held off long enough for us to have our whole weekend, pack up, and we were just finishing our ice cream as all heck broke loose.

Of course it then rained all afternoon on us at the house, but it didn't matter by then.Â  I attribute this fortuitous timing to Nikki, who manages to make the impossible happen on a regular basis.

In short our weekend was relaxed, and very fun.Â  We spent most of it in the pool with the kids, with short breaks for food, bingo and cards (with the exception of Cael, who decided to brush up on an old hobby instead of playing cards: screaming).

So, there's not a heck of a lot of news here, really.Â  We all had a great time, as we always do, and I was very spoiled.Â  Pretty awesome for me.

Thanks Nik, you rock.Â  I love ya, baby.
