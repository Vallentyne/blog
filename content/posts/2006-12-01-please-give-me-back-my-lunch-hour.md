I will never have the time I spent on [this Flash game](http://newyorkdesign.hp.infoseek.co.jp/menu06.html) back, so whatever you do, don't click on this link.

It's a fiendishly difficult game where you try to spot the differences before the time runs out.Â  Some pictures stumped me for a good long while....Â  Wilson, this game is right up your alley since it's all about the subtle differences in a series of photographs.Â  I expect big things (I made it to level 27 before fiscal responsibility kicked in).Â  I'm not sure if there is an end or what happens since I have physically torn my eyes away from the screen and am going to do some useful work elsewhere.

I stole this from [Table of Malcontents](http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2006/11/find_it_fascina.html), which is a good source of Internet weirdness.
