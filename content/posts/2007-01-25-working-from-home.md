Oh man, if there was ever an article that Nikki could respond to, [this is it](http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/01/18/how-to-manage-kids-in-the-home-office/).Â  It's a bit on how to cope with working from home with kids in the house.Â  The first big decision is open-door or closed-door.Â  I can just see Nikki now struggling with this one:Â  "If I close the door I'm working in peace and quiet and I can't hear the kids.Â  But if I close the door, I can't hear the kids and what they are getting into.Â  Yep, door stays open."

Anyway, it's not a bad read for us parent-types.
