See, I scan the news and look for weird stuff and strange coincidences so you don't have to.Â  This time it was easy, but it isn't always, people.

First we have a 73 year old lady who [dropped a spoon](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/22/4438259-ap.html) in her kitchen.Â  Then her house blew up.Â  Turns out dropping the spoon probably saved her life since she was bent down behind her sink and counter which prevented debris from hitting her.Â  She kept the spoon.

Then, a 90 year old woman was [partying it up](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/22/4438236-ap.html), celebrating her birthday with some friends and family.Â  After the party she went to bed, but was awakened by the smoke alarm in the night.Â  She then proceeded to run barefoot out of the house over to her daughter's house, without her cane and escaped the fire.Â  That is one sprightly 90 year old.Â  I can hardly make it to one of the kids rooms in the middle of the night, let alone get my rickety body out the door in an emergency.

Finally, a not so old lady was arrested for [beating on people with a hammer](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/22/4438238-ap.html) while she was naked.Â  I didn't make it up, go and look for yourself.Â  No word on who she was trying to nail.

So there you go.Â  Some days it's easy, like yesterday when those three stories came through on Canoe's Weird news feed almost at the same time. Â  No sir, sometimes I have to read a lot of stuff to find stupid things to bring you.Â  You should appreciate it more.Â  Really.
