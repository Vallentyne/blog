Here's a nice one about a couple that apparently had quite the fight.  I guess they made up and he thought they were ok and they started to fool around on the bed.  She tied him up and got a kitchen knife and bobbitted him.  Then she flushes the thing down the toilet, unties him and drives him to the hospital.  So, the police and a plumber come back to his house, arrest her and pull the toilet up from the floor where they were able to retrieve the thing, and the hospital re-attached it.

I know you were wondering too, so I found this article that describes just what the heck is involved with that sort of thing, and just how long can these things remain, um, unattached?

Wow.
