Ahh good times.

Spent four hours painting the basement last night, so tired I slept in, made the whole house late, didn't get to work until 9:40 this morning.

So, naturally I feel like a million bucks.  It reminds me of Arlo Guthrie's lyric on Alice's Restaurant.

"I went down to get my physical examination one
day, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so
I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning."

Except that I didn't have a thing to drink.  Somewhat depressing.

Anyway, that's life.  Having some infrastructure problems at home, it seems that the good folks that fight spam have (rightly) decided that anybody with a Roger's IP is a spam risk.  I fall into this category unfortunately.  So now we can't send mail to some folks.  Don't take it personally if you don't hear from us for a bit ok?  Maybe I can get it fixed tonight.....

sigh.  less sleep.
