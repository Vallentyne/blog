Who are these scientists working for anyway?  Which side are they on?

They have successfully resurrected a dog.... from the dead of course.  It's a chilling procedure (badabing!) in which the dog's blood is replaced by a frosty saline solution.  The dog then kicks the bucket.  Then after several hours, they pump the poor bugger full of blood again, shock his heart and he's back.  Not very dog-friendly, sure, but apparently the dogs are none the wiser after their ordeal.  They just chase sticks, run around, devour human brains and scratch themselves like always.
