It's springtime in Ottawa with a vengeance.  It's supposed to be 14C today.

After much discussion and debate, Nikki and I finally agreed that, yes, Jordy didn't have to wear a toque, scarf, mitts and snowpants to school.  Call us soft if you will, but we just can't say no to that kid.  Cracked out the spring coat myself officially today (could have been wearing it for a week now probably).  Picked up 1 metric ton of dog crap from the front lawn on the weekend.  Had another long, measuring look at the Christmas lights that still hang from the house and decided they would win for at least another week, but they haven't heard the last of me (shakes fist).

You don't want to rush into these things, they take time.
