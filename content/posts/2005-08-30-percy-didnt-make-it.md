My thoughts on the parenting skills that Nikki possesses are [well](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/01/heres_some_proo.html) [known](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/10/nikki_is_a_supe.html).  I can't understand how she does it, to be honest.  I called just today and was treated to the combined vocal talents of the two boys each screaming at the same time for different reasons, for what lasted at least 5 minutes before Nikki said "You don't have to listen to this" and we hung up with them still going...

But I called back because I wasn't sure that the boys would survive the hour.  A tired-sounding Nikki answered the phone and we didn't exchange two more words before I heard her talking to Cael.  

Cael: "Percy, Percy" (or what passes for Percy in Cael's current vocabulary.  Percy is one of the trains from Thomas, in case you are like, totally out of it)
Nikki: "Percy died.  He's dead.  There's nothing left of him but hunks of metal.  Yeah, all gone.  Here's your milk."

So you know, Cael is just ever so slightly attached to these trains, much in the way that you "sort of like" having your arm attached to your elbow.

Anyway, I thought you may want to have these parenting tips handy, advice right from an expert.
