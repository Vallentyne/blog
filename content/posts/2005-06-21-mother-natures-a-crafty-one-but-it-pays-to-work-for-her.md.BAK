Things are heating up on the "bipeds-vs-the rest of the natural world" war.

First off, more evidence that Mother Nature isn't above tampering with things if it works to her advantage.  A [report of a cat born with two faces](http://www.azcentral.com/offbeat/articles/0617Kitten-ON.html), one brain.  Yep, if that isn't Mother Nature's first cut at replacement politicians, I don't know what is.  It can speak out of both sides of it's mouth at the same time!  It's a natural, and certain to win in the next federal election.

Then we move on to a more puzzling entry in her starting roster.  [This little guy](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2005/6/19/nation/11262103&sec=nation).  He's adorable, has six legs, two penises, and a really long tongue.  Now, before I jump to any conclusions about what dastardly deeds he is due to unleash on humanity, let's just think for a minute about Mother Nature's team benefits package.  Seriously.

This little bugger is basically set for life in dog terms.  I mean think about it.  He must be fast, he's got 6 legs.  That means he can outrun anything.  He can probably scratch all sorts of places that 4 legs can't; less itching, which is a leading cause of dog distress.  Not only that, but do I really need to describe what a dog would do if he had two penises?  Why, run down two people on his six legs and give two people a mighty humping at the same time, that's what.  Or pee on twice as many things in 50% of the time.

Man, that little dog has a very happy future ahead of him.  I'm a little jealous.
