Man, it must be hard to be a Billy Bob.

In case you haven't been following this, [Billy Bob Thornton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bob_Thornton) and his band the Boxmasters made an appearance on a CBC radio show (inexplicably also filmed and available on YouTube, below) recently.Â  Good old Billy Bob (can I call you Billy?Â  or maybe Jerk?) took offense when the radio host mentioned that he is an actor too.Â  Imagine that, he's also an actor.Â  Anyway, what followed was the strangest interview I have ever seen, and it amounted to a hissy fit of epic proportions.Â  This man is off his rocker if he thinks his little band would be going anywhere if he wasn't also globally known as an actor.Â  His star power is opening doors for his music career, and then he pitches a fit when someone mentions that he's an actor?Â  It's crazy.Â  And no, Billy, you are not [Tom Petty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty), that much is clear.Â  Tom has been a legendary musician and recording for over 30 years, while you got bored with acting and started a vanity band a couple of years back.Â  Also, from all accounts, Tom is a nice person.

Good times, and despite his recent [apology](http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/news/archive/2009/04/10/660220.aspx) to all of Canada, it seems that Billy can't take the heat and is [packing up his crap](http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/616937) and leaving town, with his tour unfinished.Â  Yep, that sure seems like what a professional musician would do.Â  Good job.

You can't have it both ways buddy.

Here's Billy Bob making a fool of himself for everyone to see.Â  It's a credit to the host that he handled himself as coolly as he did to that pathetic display.
