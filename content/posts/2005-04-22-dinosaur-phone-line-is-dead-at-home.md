Just a little heads up, the good folks at Bell seem to have started celebrating their strike by running through the central office with golf cleats on, and our phone line is down at the moment.  Strangely enough, our good neighbour's lines went down yesterday.  You don't suppose the Bell line technicians are able to negotiate a better contract if the trouble ticket call volume is nice and high during the negotiations, do you?

Please use the cell numbers if you really need to get a hold of us.

As for me, I'm back on the Vonage web site, looking at other options.
