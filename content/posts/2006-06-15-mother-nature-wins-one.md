Looks like we are giving one to Mother Nature to soften her up a bit.  They [sunk an aircraft carrier](http://www.irishmansoftware.com/Oriskany.htm) off the coast of Florida to form an [artificial reef](http://www.ussoriskany.com/id18.html).  It's an amazing set of pictures, that's one huge ship going down.

Saw this on [Metafilter](http://www.Metafilter.com).
