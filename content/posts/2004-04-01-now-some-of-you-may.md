Now some of you may be asking yourselves, how is Nikki taking the news of Court quitting his job and following his dream? Well, I'll tell you. At first I was a little taken aback, but then I realized I was just being selfish. Always thinking about me, me, me. That isn't healthy in a marriage, y'know? What kind of wife would I be if I didn't support his lifelong dream? I know I'm going to have to have a thick skin in terms of all the girls that will be tucking money into his g-string, but the truth of it is, the last lap dance of the evening will always be mine. Go get 'em honey!
