Hey there.  

So, the skating party seemed to be a big success, at least I had a ball totterring around on the new CCM Punishers.  Thanks to everybody for coming out and lacing up, and even those that didn't really lace up but still played some pretty fierce hockey.  We didn't even have too many injuries, which is a shocker when you think of it, mixing ice and alcohol.  What were we thinking?  We took some pictures but I haven't yanked them off the camera yet, so stick around.  As for mentionables, let's see....  




Kent comes to mind, for taking what I'm told was a huge header, think Bobby Orr only on his back.  Hopefully no long term damage there, buddy.  Also congrats to Kyle for taking one "in between the pipes" while in nets.  Way to go, taking one for the team.  For sportsman-like play, Jim for taking Nikki out of the play handily with what I'm sure was a legal hit.  Also, cousin PJ for scoring 37 times, albeit against a couple of second graders.  Allison for having the eye of the tiger.  Jordy and Courtney for switching teams at will and not telling anybody.  Tristan for skating way way better than me.  Jenna for being on the ice at all with those crazy big people.  Mark and Nancy for bringing the lads out for a play, the ice got a good buffing thanks to them.




There, that must be almost everybody.  Except for Quinn, who I am glad decided to wait until Sunday night to cut a monster tooth and keep us up all night.  Thanks buddy.




Well, back to work kids.
