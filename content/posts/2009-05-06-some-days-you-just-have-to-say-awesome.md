Today I decided to continue on a task that has been staring me in the face for a while.  We started to clean out the basement - something that has taken us 8 to 9 years to destroy - in order to help prep the house for our new addition to the family....a SAINT BERNARD!  Yes, we are idiots, but that is nothing new to anyone who knows us.Â Â  This is our new bouncing baby boy seen here below at 6 weeks old.Â  Keep it under wraps though (as I write this on the internet...) because the two boys don't know about him.Â  It's a surprise.Â  Jordy found us out when the "puppy" dog food arrived.Â  DOH!![puppies-6-weeks-old-049](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/puppies-6-weeks-old-049-300x224.jpg)


In addition to this nightmare of a task...there's the whole jewelry business re-org that is 3-4 years overdue.  Yeesh.  There is presently NO dining room table as a result of this undertaking - make me nuts!  Then there is the craft smorgasbord blob that I have been nursing and feeding for the last 13 years for the kids.  Didn't know I even had half the craft supply stuff that is here so, better just buy it again....and so the mound grows and grows.  Holy accumulation batman!  It's nuts.  I could open our own dollar store. (Not something I'm proud of.)

So Court and I decided to take on this beast before the new little beast (that will grow to 225lbs+) arrives.  Hmm!  Who knew that, DAMN(!)  that would feel SOOOOO good.  So today I continue on and slowly start to feel the feelings of being overwhelmed dissipate.  The basement is starting to take shape, the Jewelry re-org is in progress but the house is still demolished.  That too will be remedied eventually.  Nothing like a house full of company all weekend to light a fire under one's buttocks in that regard.

So what has this declutterization done for me? (Besides allow me the "Colbert" privilege of creating a new word?) ALOT!  Suddenly I'm thinking, "Hey, my kids are healthy and happy! -AWESOME!" , "I have the best hubby in the world who loves me no matter how overwhelmed I get! - AWESOME!", "I'm hanging out with my girl-y peeps for Mother's Day on Friday for dinner and drinks! - AWESOME!", "There are new beginnings with the extened family that make me want to burst with happiness! - AWESOME!",  "I have friends that know what it is like to live the crazy at-home-mom life with a litter of kids and that alone is refreshing! - AWESOME!"

OH!  And finally, we have this new addition coming.  Now,... and just now, (because we are finally getting our act together) I can finally get excited about our new furry little man who will arrive here on the evening of May 15th. - AWESOME!

Take on 3 kids (one of which is a teenager, two of which are young boys)? CHECK!Â  How about 2 Large Breed dogs? Sure!  Why not, what the hell! -Â  I'm feeling.....wait for it.....AWESOME!
