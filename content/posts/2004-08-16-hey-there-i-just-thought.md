Hey there!

I just thought I would jump on the blog for a brief moment to placate Lockrey. I was the recipient of a seething email this morning about the lack of content on the blog. It is also possible, that this isn't coming in a timely fashion either, (by _her _standards) and therefore may potentially terminate whatever is left of the friendship we presently have. I would like it publicly known that I am doing my part, right now to pacify her :-P

Court and I were let out on a day/overnight pass by our kind and merciful family.  Whit and Mummsie agreed to lay sanity aside, and baby-sit overnight for us so we could enjoy a stay at the Chateau Laurier with Ben & Leanne. Great fun was had. We hit a cobblestone patio for lunch and a beer. (I can't recall the name, but it is behind "The Black Tomato").  We then walked to the next pub for a beer afterwards. We were reconnected with the city life, and all the unique individuals that frequent the market. We saw some break dancers, a scary blue guy, and some mimes. Great musical talent was everywhere we went.

We then decided it was dinner time and headed off to the hotel to get ready for dinner (and have a beer).   Off to the Japanese Village we went and ordered a refreshing, wait for it, yes, a beer. Some of us opted for wine occasionally. Ah, then we were fat and happy and toddled off to buy our Yuk Yuk's tickets. Show starts at 10:30, it's now 8:30. Better head to Darcy McGee's (sp?) and have a - no, not a beer (well, Courtney did), a rye and coke. Or something of that variety. Look at the time. We better have one more before we hit the show. Ok! Off to Yuk Yuk's and the show was awesome. Enhanced only by the Pitcher of Beer the waitress with the halo brought to us.

After all that gut wrenching laughter, these old folks hit the hay. We had a delightful breakfast at the hotel the next day and shopped the market again, doing basically the same thing as the day before, but slower. We were home late afternoon to rested, and clean, children. Ah, sweet, sweet, in-laws. God love them. Thanks guys! We had a lot of fun. From all we've been hearing, the kids did too, and miss you already. You are way more fun than tired old mom!

Out!
