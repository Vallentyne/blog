When we finally decided that the boys could play football this year, after several years of the boys nagging to play, I might add, I don't think we really knew what we were in for. We knew about the schedule, and the possibility that the guys might not make the team if they got cut. In short, we had no idea.

The fun part about the practices (admittedly we have only had a handful so far) is watching the kids start to understand the drills, and even now start to get better. The coaches are tough, but so far you can feel it's going to be a fun year.

I wonder how we will feel about it all after another 50 practices.....
