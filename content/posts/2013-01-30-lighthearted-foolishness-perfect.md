I'm really loving this story about 9 high school friends who have been playing tag for 23 years.Â  Literally.Â  The game started in high school, and then on the last day of school the guy who was "it" couldn't tag anyone.Â  He was "it" for 8 more years until they had a reunion and decided to start the game again.Â  They had all moved away from each other, so the rules were that the game was only open for the month of February each year.Â  If you got tagged, you were it for the whole year.Â  Elaborate stunts, travel, traps and stalking ensued, and I think this is just awesome.

I can see this ultimately ending with a dramatic low speed chase in rascal scooters in Florida.....

Nice work guys, keep it up.
