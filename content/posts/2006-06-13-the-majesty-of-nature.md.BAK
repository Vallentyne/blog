Some of Mother Nature's creations need a little more love than others.  You really have to try hard to love [this little guy](http://animalpicturesarchive.com/Arch04/1133697419.jpg), for instance.  Creatively called an [aye-aye](http://www.wildmadagascar.org/wildlife/species/lemurs/Daubentonia_madagascariensis.html) because it has two of them, I suppose, this little guy is one of the less fortunate creatures on our planet.  I mean come on, this thing is pretty freaky looking.  It uses those ears to listen for grubs under the bark of trees, which it digs out with those crazy long fingers.  Anyway, true to most creatures I guess, the babies are [much cuter](http://lemur.duke.edu/animals/ayeaye/reproduction.php) than the adults, which is part of Mother Nature's plan to keep the adults from being disgusted with their offspring, I would imagine.
