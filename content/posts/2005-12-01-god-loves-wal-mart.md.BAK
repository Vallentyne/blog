Follow me on this one:  
Here's a [link to a picture of a newspaper article](http://flickr.com/photos/swagcool_theatre/42034179/in/pool-52241540011@N01/) about the opening of the world's largest Wal-Mart (woohoo).  I guess the store manager got a little carried away, or he was visited by the rapture, or something, because he is quoted in the local newspaper as follows:



<blockquote>"This is the day that the Lord has made! We shall rejoice and be glad in the new Wal-Mart that the Lord has made."

-Lester Packingham
Wal-Mart General Manager</blockquote>



Wow.  If this is true, it's scaaaaarrry.

If God loves Wal-Marts so much, why does he smite them with airplanes so often?  It all started when one of the chief mucky mucks, John Walton, heir to the Wal-Mart fortune crashed his airplane and [bought it](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160858,00.html).  He was worth 18 billion (!) at the time, but was flying a home-made airplane...  And then remember the [airplane that fell on a Wal-Mart?](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/11/sprawlmart.html)  It's weird, isn't it?
