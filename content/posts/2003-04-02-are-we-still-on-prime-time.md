Are we still on prime-time, family-oriented viewing? Cause you're gonna get an earful...er...eyeful if we're not! Ali, Jamie and I could bog (blog?) your server down with alternative politcal rhetoric!

You know what the only thing I regret about that picture is? The stupid Coors light shirt (well, that and the big ol' double chin. But I'm workin' on that)...cause, man! That fur coat IS righteous! The only thing better would be Donnie Osmond's coat from Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat!
