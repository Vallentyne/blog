You Can't:

- explain to a 3 year old that you don't always have to take off all your clothes (even socks) to sit on the toilet
- understand the subtle nuances of brotherly relationships unless you had one (I'm guessing here)
- get all children dressed for the outdoors without becoming annoyed by at least one of them
- expect to go to bed early and sleep through the night because the kids somehow know it in their soul and wake up several times to yell for you and at you for no good reason
- make a nutritious supper that all children like, every time you make it.  They all like everything some of the time, but never all at the same time.
- predict who exactly will have a "problem" with the family routine being upset.  It's always somebody, and always somebody different.
