Hey everyone!
I just wanted to post a quick blog to say **"THANKS"** to everyone who came to 28 Nairn Street to celebrate the holidays.  We had a really great time seeing everyone.  Be sure to mark your calendars for next year.  Friday December 17th will be the 5th Annual Christmas Party.  We hope you all can make it again.

Before we go a whole year though, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the regular updates, that Court will no doubt post, regarding the construction of this year's rink.  We are really pumped about the whole thing.  Should all go well, we plan to have the 2nd annual Potluck Skating party, and rope "Good Neighbour Jim" into the whole plan (as half the rink is his after all)!

This may be the last blog I make this year, as I doubt I will have much time to post with Jordynn off school for the holidays, and Christmas just around the corner.  Not to mention the upcoming birth of a new Vallentyne.  That being said, I wish you all a safe, healthy, warm and happy holiday.  Merry Christmas!
