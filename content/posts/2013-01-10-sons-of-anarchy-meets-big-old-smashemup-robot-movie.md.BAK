So, it seems that [Charlie Hunnam ](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402271/)has been doing other things besides riding around on Harleys, he's been making a movie that's kinda Iron Man meets Cloverfield/Godzilla.Â  Looks like a video game to me, and ya I'll basically pay to watch any movie that spends that much on CGI just cause I like it that way.Â  Nikki probably not so much, but if I tell her Jax is in it, I may have a chance.

It's called Pacific Rim and it looks darn cool.
