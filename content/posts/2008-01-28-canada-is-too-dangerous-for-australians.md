The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade runs a website for citizens of Australia called Safe Travellers, and apparently it has decided it has had enough and [decided to call Canada a risky destination](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/01/25/4793424-cp.html) for Aussie travellers.Â  Chile, South Korea and Latvia are among the countries listed that are deemed to be _**safer**_ than Canada.Â  Yep, apparently there are just too many avalanches, forest firesÂ and earthquakes.Â  Here's a quote from the Canoe article:


<blockquote>

> 
> <blockquote>Apparently our problems stem from the threat of terrorism, heavy snow, ice and forest fires that can erupt "at any time."

British Columbia, in particular, was singled out as being in an active earthquake zone and "subject to avalanches" along with Alberta.</blockquote>

It's true, you know.Â  Hunt Club was a mess this morning, there were two forest fires jackknifed at Riverside, it had traffic snarled for quite a ways back.Â 

You know what's incredible?Â  The absolute GALL of thisÂ coming from Australia, where literally every living creature there can kill you as an afterthought.Â  I'm serious, I've been there.Â  Even the smallest little spider is literally a crazed demonic fiend, lusting for human flesh, poisonous to even look at.Â  It's a wonder anybody can live there at all.Â  Want proof?Â  Here's some links from Australia's travel section on about.com:Â  [goaustralia.about.com](http://goaustralia.about.com)

The list goes on, I just don't have time to document them all.Â  We must be some badass mothers living in Canada if Aussies are scared to come **_HERE_**.Â  It's hilarious.
