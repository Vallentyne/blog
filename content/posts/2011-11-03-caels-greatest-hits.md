I had been saving a few choice Cael-isms up for a future post, or for use in another way, but it never happened for one reason or another.Â  So here is a list of some of Cael's better moments.Â  To say that the kid has a gift is probably an understatement, he's only 7 and regularly cracks us up.Â  So, without further ado, some raw unfiltered goodness from the man himself:

Cael on music:


<blockquote>There is no rock and roll in Arnprior, it's just a bunch of singers and banjos. Â A bunch of honey bunnies Â and slow motion singers.</blockquote>


Cael on Arnprior, againÂ (perhaps a tad harsh?)


<blockquote>Arnprior is just like a village where no one has water, like in Rango.</blockquote>


Cael once mentioned about how we don't have cable TV anymore, and when he does get a chance to watch it there often doesn't seem to be anything on...


<blockquote>Daytime television is just a bunch of "So Barbaras" (pronounce that phonetically and you get "soap operas")</blockquote>


Cael on getting kisses from Nikki before leaving for school in the morning.


<blockquote>He comes flying into the bathroomÂ doing some serious karate chopping and fancy footwork going Hiya! Hiya! and I laughed and he says, "I'm the LOVE NINJA! - here for my lovin's"</blockquote>


Cael on how amazing his beautiful mom is:


<blockquote>You smell like when unicorns existed.Â  <looks around> Don't tell anybody, it might get out of hand...</blockquote>


Cael after Trick-or-treating for little while, starts to feel a little tired and asks:


<blockquote>How long have we been hitting the sacks, anyway?</blockquote>


Cael on putting on his precious hockey team toque for the first time:


<blockquote>Ahh, it still has that new toque smell.</blockquote>


Cael got into trouble last year with his teacher, and she was going to punish him and call us to tell us about it.


<blockquote>Mrs. C - "I'm calling your mother"

Cael - "No, I'll make you a deal"

Mrs. C - "Ok,".....

Cael - "I'll give you 50 pushups if you don't call my mom"

Mrs. C -Â "I'm calling your mother"

.... and she did</blockquote>


Buddy, you are just the frigging best.Â  Don't change one bit.Â  If you know one I have forgotten, by all means comment and remind me.
