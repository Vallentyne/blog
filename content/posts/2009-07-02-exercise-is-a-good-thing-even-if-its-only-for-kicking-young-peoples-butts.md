If you ever needed an excuse to stay in shape as you get older, how's this one for you?

A neighbourly disagreement over loud music and noise [ended rather badly for a complete moron](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196479/Pictured-The-battered-bruised-face-burglar-got-wrong-72-year-old-boxer.html) who deserved exactly what he got.Â  A 24 year old drunken arsehole tried to break into the home of a 72 year old man and his wife and threatened them with a knife, but ended up getting the crap kicked out of him by the homeowner who just happened to be a former boxing champion in his youth.Â  The pictures of this moron are so fitting, it's got to be karma.Â  It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy, it seems. The ex-boxer apparently landed just two punches, but from the pictures it looks more like the guy was in a car accident.Â  Definitely not someone to be messed with.Â  Saw the link on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/07/02/elderly-retired-boxi.html) first.

We have covered [kick-ass elderly folks before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/02/13/fit-as-a-fiddle/), and to be honest it makes me very happy to think that I might be strong and able for a while to come.Â  It's going to be a necessity so I can try to keep three children in line, right?Â  Not to mention two huge dogs.

Finally, from [the blog of one of the creators of P90x](http://steve-edwards.blogspot.com/2009/07/limbaugh-exercise-to-blame-for-health.html) (again, which I have [talked about before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/04/04/getting-fit/) and am still using) a wonderful soundbite from that paragon of rational thought, as well as physical fitness, Rush Limbaugh.Â  Click through to hear this idiot say with a straight face that folks who exercise are what's putting a strain on the American health care system.Â  Good lord, but this guy is a jerkoff.
