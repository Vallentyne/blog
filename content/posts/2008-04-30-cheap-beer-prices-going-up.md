An articleÂ on Canoe.ca today warnsÂ me to enjoy that cheap beer because [prices are going up](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/04/30/5428641-sun.html) soon.Â  I have only one answer to that:Â  HUH?Â  If the prices I'm paying now are cheap prices, it looks like I will just cut beer right out altogether.Â  I like beer.Â  I love beer.Â  But today's beer prices are not cheap, not even close.Â (cue the old geezer voice)Â  I remember when you could buy a case of beer for, uh, well aÂ lot less than you can today.Â  It really is a lot more expensive these days, I don't understand why.Â 

Now keen readers of this blog will already know that beer prices are going to go up because I told you that already this month.Â  Or rather, [a scientist from New Zealand](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/04/08/victorias-bitter-indeed/) told us that.

You may start to think that all I think about is beer, but that's not true I was also thinking about [beer and wine](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/06/06/booze-news/) at the same time a little while ago.Â  In any case (that's a beer pun),Â summer is just around the corner, and since those climate folks are predicting a warm one, I suggest we all [stock up](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/04/09/beer-panic/) for the warm weather.Â  Ah beer, how can I stay mad at you?
