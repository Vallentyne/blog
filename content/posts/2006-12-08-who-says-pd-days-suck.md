So in addition to my last post on humility and how humble your children can make you...without even trying, here's a little tidbit of my beautiful morning so far.  Bear with me while I gush.  Unlike some parents, I welcome the PD days.  The morning is more relaxed and everyone is generally peaceful.  There's no rushing, running and nagging involved.

I came down the stairs this morning to see that Jordy was on her way up with breakfast in bed for me.  That got sidetracked on her as Cael wanted his breakfast (and not in bed) but the thought was there and she was praised highly for her thoughtfulness.  Then, as I scurried around the kitchen doing the usual chores of dishwasher unloading and such I made the announcement that we would be going to the mall to purchase birthday gifts for the birthday parties that two of the three kids are attending this weekend.  YAY!  Everyone is excited about that.  Jordy says, "C'mon Cael!  Let's get dressed!"  She takes Cael upstairs and decides that she will change him and get him ready so we can go.  What an angel!  Then I hear, "Quinn, c'mon and help!" This could get interesting but I wait and let it go to see what they are conspiring upstairs.  Ah, Mama is actually having a hot cup of coffee.

I listen carefully from downstairs as they giggle and whisper.  Then Quinn proclaims from the top of the stairs with the same enthusiasm as though he just saw Santa himself, "MOMMY, MOMMY!!!  Cael is dressed and he looks just like Daddy!  He's SOOOOOOOOO handsome!"

Oh now, this is just getting too cute. So then I hear more whispering and I hear Quinn say to Cael, "Ok, you get behind me so Mommy doesn't see."  Then they come down to unveil Cael.  Quinn stood in front of Jordy and said his line, "Voila Cael!"  And Jordy presented Cael with her arms outstretched and stepped back.

Well, you should have seen this little guy.  I'll try to get a picture. Jordy slicked his hair down like Ward Cleaver with about as much hair gel as necessary for a small village, and they have a dress shirt on him with some khaki's.  The cake topper though was the spray of Daddy's cologne on the wee man.  It's enough to make your eyes water.  He's beaming proudly though and they are all sitting in a row on the couch watching a show waiting for time to go to the mall.  They are awesome, and BRING ON THE PD DAYS I SAY!

PS - It is probably worth mentioning that Cael has an eye and ear infection and has felt better.  It's nice to see how the kids work together to make the weakest feel best.  After this morning, I don't care what is said about me publicly on the radio, and I don't care what teacher's notes say, and I could care less if all of Hazeldean mall is ordered to evacuate in an orderly fashion due to an unsuspecting fire alarm.  Bring it on.
