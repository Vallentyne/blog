Here's a neat article.  Somebody found a frog perfectly [preserved in amber](http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/02/16/frog.in.amber.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories) that is probably 25 million years old.  Anyway, the scientists want to drill this thing and get a sample of the frog's DNA.  Which would of course allow him to clone it and re-create a long-lost species of killer frogs that would soon end all human life as we know it.  Think Jurassic Park and you've got it exactly.  Or maybe they would just hop around a lot, and eat mosquitoes.  Could be, you never know with these things.

Anyway, I saw the article and immediately thought of that Bugs Bunny segment where the construction worker finds a frog in the concrete of the building he is demolishing.  It sings show tunes perfectly, but it only sings for him and eventually ruins him.  Some things we just aren't meant to find..... this frog is probably one of those.
