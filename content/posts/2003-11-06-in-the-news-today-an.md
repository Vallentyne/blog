In the news today, an [important scientific discovery.](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994343)  This is definitely something that makes me proud to be Canadian, and even more certain that we need to give our Universities more money.  In case you didn't click the link, here's the first line of the article.

"Biologists have linked a mysterious, underwater farting sound to bubbles coming out of a herring's anus."

Yep, you better believe it.  (Rocket) Scientists at the University of British Columbia have spent some time on this one, kids.  Other points of interest:  The Herrings only fart after dark, they seem to communicate this way, and the noise apparently answers the vexing question as to how the schools of herring stay together after dark.  Also, the article states with a completely deadpan tone; "It was at this point that the team named the noise Fast Repetitive Tick (FRT)."  Um, yeah.

There is even a [link to a wav](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bwilson/Herring_sound.wav) file so you too can experience the majestic sound of a herring breaking wind in the cold dark waters of the North Sea.  It gives you goosebumps, doesn't it?

I can just imagine the nature shows picking up on this one, Crocodile Hunter style.

"Alright, here we are in the North Sea, it's 9pm and we are stealthily approaching a large school of herring from behind in our submarine.  If we are lucky these little blokes will start ripping them off like crazy and we will be in for a jolly good show.  I've never seen such an array of fish butts in my whole life.  It's mesmerizing, watching them.  Crikey!  There they go!  I've never seen anything like it, it's like being in a jacuzzi.  We're being knocked about in our little submarine, but we should be alright.  It's truly one of nature's wonders."

Ok, that was a little over the top, but this is a fairly strange one, wouldn't you agree?
