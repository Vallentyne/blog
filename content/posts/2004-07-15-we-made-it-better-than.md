We made it.

Better than that, it was even fun.  Ontario Place on Thursday, Wonderland on Friday, and the Toronto Zoo on Saturday.  No sane person would do that, but we did it with three kids and lived to tell the tale.  Not that we didn't have our moments of doubt (rage and panic), and the odd trying circumstance (crushing hopelessness), but nonetheless we actually thought we might do it again sometime.

Not soon, mind you, but sometime.
