Oh, if there's one thing I love in this world, it's people.Â  People are awesome.Â  They never cease to delight, disgust and amaze me.Â  For instance, [this  Florida grandmother](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2010/11/06/16005846.html?cid=rssnewsweird%20news), who decided that being a grandmother was a little too much work, and tried to sell her grandson.Â  Somebody talked, the police got involved, and they conducted a sting operation to catch her.Â  During the negotiation portion of the transaction, the undercover informant actually managed to haggle (HAGGLE!) the purchase price (OF A CHILD) down from $75000 to $30000.Â  Upon exchanging the money, the police swooped in and arrested the "grandmother".

This story is noteworthy all by itself, but astute readers might wonder where the child's mother (or father) might be during this activity.Â  It seems that the mother was already in jail (on charges of unrelated douchebaggery), and left her child in her mother's care.Â  Dear old Granny.Â  The child is now in state custody, and hopefully will find a home somewhere that is a bit more stable REAL SOON NOW.

Cripes.

Yes these things do write themselves sometimes.
