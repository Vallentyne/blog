Well, it'sÂ traditional for all professional bloggers and journalist type folks to end the year with a retrospective of the year, or a top ten list of some sort.Â  I certainly don't pretend to be either of those, so no list from me.Â  As for retrospective, well there's no future in that.Â  So I'll just put on my preacher hat and say to anyone who happens to read this:Â  take a look around you and grab hold of the people who are most precious to you.Â  Give them a good hug and tell them you love them.Â  If that's all you can do today, that's still a good start for the year.

That's it for 2007, bring on 2008.
