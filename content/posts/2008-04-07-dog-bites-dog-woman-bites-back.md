When a pit bull attacked her Lab, [a Minneapolis woman bit back](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/04/03/5182586-ap.html).Â  She literally bit the pit bull on the nose, after which the dog released her Lab.

Gotta give her credit for having guts.  Sounds like someone you wouldn't want to tangle with, generally.

Lockrey?  Is that you?
