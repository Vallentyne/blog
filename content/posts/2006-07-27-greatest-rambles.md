Yes, it's summer rerun time, folks.

Since I'm currently experiencing a creativity block, I thought I would do what TV does and just regurgitate some old stuff and call it new.  Hey, it's my party, I can do whatever I want, right?

Anyway, here's some of the old stuff.

- Way back in October 2003 Nikki and I went to Quebec City and had a run in with some [jerks at a bed and breakfast](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2003/10/hyuk_hyuk_thats.html).  Be sure to check out the next few posts too 'cause Nikki tries to get her revenge, but it doesn't go as planned.

- The author tag got lost along the way, but Ali posted this pearl:  [She was born in 1915. That's a lot of driving experience.](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2003/11/monday_mornings.html)

- Somewhat pithy [words of wisdom](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/02/well_the_skatin.html) on parenting a ~2yr old, Quinn at the time, but which still ring true to this day.

- [The Nissan Sentra Saga](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/04/this_just_in_fr.html)

- And finally or at least for tonight, [The Feral Baby](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/09/its_been_two_we.html)
