Another post in the music vein, good old Neil is [stirring up some good stuff against George Bush](http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/18/leisure.young.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories) it would seem.  It's not your subtle discontent sort of thing, either.  It's pretty straightforward protest stuff, including a song called "Let's Impeach the President".  I'm thinking that makes his position rather clear.  Anyway, Neil always makes interesting stuff, it should be good to see what happens once this hits the streets.
