Ok, so this is my first few weeks with the Movable Type software, and I know I have a few kinks left to work out with the publishing from behind the firewall at work.  There are some other quirks that take getting used to, but I had a little glitch that really burned me.  I had a post all queued up yesterday at work, and lost it when I hit publish... oh, that's not good folks.  It's not like the level of writing is so good here in the first place, and then when I do eke out a few words and links and lose them, well that's a real blow to the content here, as all 3 of my faithful readers can attest.

Anyway, I'm ok now.  Onward and upward as they say.
