In case you can't figure it out, it reads exactly:


<blockquote>Plan A

I bomb his base intil its destroyed.

Luckely he can't read so he can't figyrer out my plan

<whoosh>Â  <bang></blockquote>


There's no other plan mentioned, or required.Â  The course is laid before us, and it is absolute, and it shall end with the utter destruction of "him", known to us as Cael.Â  Whoosh, bang, indeed.

To be read followed by a long gleeful cackle, with much dry hand-rubbing.
