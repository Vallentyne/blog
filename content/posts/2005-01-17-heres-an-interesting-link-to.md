Here's an interesting link to a guy who is [selling advertising space](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4161413.stm) on his forehead on eBay. He will get a logo or a company name tattooed on his head in non-permanent ink for 30 days. He's drawing the line at pornography (D!ckhead Co. for example) or a swastika or anything. Probably not a bad idea.
