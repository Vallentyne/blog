I loves me my idiots.  They make every day better with their selfless dedication to making me feel smarterer than they.  So, [this site](http://safetycenter.navy.mil/photo/archive/default.htm) is now my favourite, for sure.  It's a [Darwin Awards](http://www.darwinawards.com/) treasure trove of utter breathtaking stupidity.  For instance, some ladder abuse:
Oh man, the sheer guts it must have taken to climb these suckers is somewhat admirable.

So there you go, have fun perusing this invaluable archive and feel immediately better about yourself and your continued existence.
