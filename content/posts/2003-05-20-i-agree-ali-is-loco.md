I agree, Ali is loco. I think if I was to jog I'd drive my ankles up into my knees. I don't want my body fat checked right now, thanks. It'd probably come up as Brando.

In ascending order of accuracy, they use either calipers (aka the pinch test), or they run a mild electric current through you, which is better. This should not be confused with what they do in the Arkansas penal system which is not so much mild as, lets say, excessive...although they'd probably be able to tell how much fat you HAD by the decibel reading from the sizzling (but the guards only keep records of that for betting purposes). You can also trundle down Hwy 417 to Ottawa U and get a buoyancy test which is the most accurate...but one doesn't just show up and ask for that.
