I'm a busy guy, things to do, people to see, a mover, a shaker; you get the idea.  So I must warn you now that clicking on any one of the following links will turn you into a drooling, slack jawed, hand-cramped, red-eyed click zombie.  Clicking on two of them will ruin your life as you know it and you will awake in a cardboard box under an off-ramp.  I clicked on them all, so you won't need to, and I don't need to tell you what this has done to my workplace productivity.  So, to recap, don't click on any of these links.  You have been warned.

First we have a silly game:  [Finger Frenzy](http://www.offthewrist.com/frenzy/index.jsp?gameId=0)  Basically a typing tutor on crack, it's a sprint to type the whole alphabet as quickly as you can.  Mildly amusing, but since I suck at typing, not that great for me.

Then it gets a bit more interesting, [Planarity](http://www.planarity.net/#) is a puzzle game that really _really_ gets hard.  Oh sure the first few levels have you snickering, but trust me when I say that things get rather difficult really quickly.

Then we have what a commenter on Digg described best:  "it's a toy, not a game".  [The Falling Sand Game](http://chir.ag/stuff/sand/) is deceptively fun in my opinion, but your mileage may vary.  I found myself strangely drawn to this thing, for whatever reason.

[Katamari Damacy](http://katamaridamacy.jp/qa_data/katamari.html) in a browser, nothing more needs to be said.  

[Flea Circus](http://www.jagex.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/fleas.ws) and [Lemmings](http://games.funnygames.nl/lemmings/) are rather alike, the big difference is that Lemmings is rather slow, while Flea circus is most definitely not.  I remember playing Lemmings when it first came out, it was really fun.   Now you can play in a browser....

And the most recent click-trance I have been subjected to:  [Blueprint](http://www.teagames.com/games/blueprint/play.php)  Very fun, well done game that I can't get much past halfway on, but still pretty neat.  It's a "mousetrap" sort of thing where you have to redirect a bouncing ball to hit a target using the tools provided.  Lots of maddening fun.

Credit for these links in no particular order goes to:  [Digg.com](http://Digg.com), [Metafilter](http://www.Metafilter.com), there may be others.
