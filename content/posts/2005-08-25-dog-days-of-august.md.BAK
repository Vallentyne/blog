It's my last few days here on the job before impending unemploymentness hits, and I'm coping rather well, if I do say so myself.  Unlike past contract endings where I start chewing on my desk a day or so before the end, this time I'm actually looking forward to a little break.  A very very little break, ideally.  Or more accurately, a short break where I already know that I have a job to go back to after the break.  I'm sure I couldn't be that lucky, but you never know. It's been almost 5 years since I even took a whole week off at one time.

Being at home could do wonders for blog posting productivity, but I wouldn't count on it.  There are too many distractions and things to do at home to really be sitting around like this, prattling on about nothing.  But that's what a blog is for, so there you go.  They really serve no practical purpose other than for casual time wasting.

So, without further ado, here's some more stuff to waste time on.

A description of a [prank about a tattoo](http://www.zug.com/pranks/tattoo/) which sounds fairly good, if a little difficult to set up.
