There's no sarcasm here, this is just an amazing story.  A couple were hiking in California when a mountain lion [attacked the man](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/25/mountain.lion.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories), who is 70 years old and must be in incredibly good health.  It had his head in it's jaws and the woman, 65, fought it off by beating it with a log. They then picked themselves up and walked a 1/4 mile to wiat for a park ranger.  He's doing ok and is recovering now.

Incredible story, and what a couple of remarkable people.
