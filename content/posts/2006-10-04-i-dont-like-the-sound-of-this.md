I think I can speak for my liver when I say [oh freaking crap](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/10/03/hops.fire.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories).Â  Four percent of the U.S. hops crop burns in a warehouse fire.Â  That ain't good, people.Â  What will that do to the price of your favourite swill?Â  Nobody can tell yet.Â  Then again, who cares?Â  This is the American hop supply, not the Canadian one, right?Â  Right?

That's two [alcohol-related](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/10/03/black-vodka/) posts in like 5 hours, you might start to wonder what's really on my mind, I know I am.
