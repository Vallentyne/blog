I sometimes have to check to see if anyone is reading, surely you understand.  




So, the basement inspection went swimmingly yesterday.  It's a bit silly, really.  The guy comes in, asks me if I put the black wires here, and the white wires there.  I say yep.  He says ok.  We have a look at the dimmers.  We open the door to the panel.  He doesn't actually touch anything.  He says ok, see you later.  I ask, when do you want to come back to have a final inspection?  He says oh I'm not coming back, you're done.




That's it.  He didn't even test anything.  Or really even look at anything I wired.  

Scary.  

Strange.  

A pretty quick $148.  




By my calculations he is making about $1776/hour.  Or about $3.4 million a year.  That's not too bad, if you can get it.  One downside to his job is the constant taking off and putting on of the shoes.  That would really wear me down after a while.  It would probably get to the point that I wouldn't want to do it anymore, no matter what they were paying me.  I mean come on, take off your shoes, put them back on, take them off, put them on.  He can keep his $3.4 million, he earned it.




On the "catchy song I can't get out of my head if I tried" front, have you heard [this one](http://www.apple.com/ipod/ads/ad2medium30.html)?  It's ridiculous, I may have heard it twice on the radio (I don't listen to the radio much anymore) and it's already taken up residence in my cerebellum.  I'm sure I will eventually tire of it (maybe you already have) but it's pretty good.




Anywho, I should skedaddle off home to get "into costume".
