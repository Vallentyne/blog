I saw a link on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/software/cooking/turn-a-5-steak-into-a-50-steak-299951.php) a while ago about how to [make your steak taste better](http://steamykitchen.com/blog/2007/08/28/how-to-turn-cheap-choice-steaks-into-gucci-prime-steaks/) when you are barbequeing.Â  The beauty of this tip is the simplicity: salt. You take your steak out of the fridge an hour or so before you cook it and completely cover it on both sides with sea salt.Â  Literally.Â  It sounds crazy, but bear with me.Â  You salt the sucker and let it sit for 15 minutes at least on the counter.Â  Then, rinse off the salt under the tap and dry the steak off with paper towels.Â  Then cook as usual.

We tried this with a very cheap steak and it tasted like a million bucks.Â  It was not over-salted by any means, if you normally use even the smallest amount on your steak it will taste just fine.Â  Apparently this works best on thick steaks (1"), but we did it on a fairly thin T-bone and it was tender and delicious.Â  Anyway, this is something you should definitely give a try.Â  Probably not that great for your blood pressure, but how often are you eating steak?Â  Really?Â  That often?Â  Wow, what a carnivore.
