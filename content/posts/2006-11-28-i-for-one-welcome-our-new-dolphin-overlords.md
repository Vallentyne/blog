When I saw this [news article](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,227572,00.html) about researchers finding a dolphin with "legs" I immediately remembered reading an article in the [Onion](http://theonion.com) that rings so incredibly true it's amazing.Â  [The Onion's take is hilarious](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28315) and worth a read, it had me crying the first time I read it:


<blockquote>

Indeed.Â  It's funny as hell, but it's also very cool that they have such a direct link to dolphins having once had limbs (the actual article, not The Onion spoof).
