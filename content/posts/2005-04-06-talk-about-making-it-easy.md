Talk about making it easy on me, this one needs no embellishment at all.

Some Star Wars nerds are [already lining up](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117920656?categoryid=1236&cs=1&s=h&p=0) to see the new movie.  It doesn't open until May 19th, though.  They are camping out in what can only be described as a flagrant disregard for ever getting laid in their entire lifetime.  This is news worthy, and they deserve to be mocked.  What is incredible however, is they are camped out at a theatre waiting for a movie that isn't actually opening at that theatre.  Apparently it is some sort of pathetic attempt to get the movie studios to change their minds and business plans about their decision to open the movie at a newer theatre some few blocks away.  So, it is almost a certainty that they will live outdoors for 45 days and still not get the "priviledge" of being one of the first to see this movie.
Stunning.
It easily brings to mind the absolutely [side-splitting bit](http://gamefiles.blueyonder.co.uk/blueyondergames/trailers/ROFL.STARWARS.NERDS.wmv) from Triumph the Wonderdog from the last movie opening.

Anyway, I'm sure that the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus will all make sure to give each and every one of these poor souls [something they are sure to cherish](http://shop.lego.com/product.asp?p=10143&cn=4&d=5&t=3).
