So it is a rainy day.  Big deal.  We can figure out something fun to do to kill some time before Quinn goes to school.  Over breakfast while we discuss our plans for the day Quinn decides to give me a little bit of insight on "love".  Out of the blue he says in between bites of Cheerios and swigs of orange juice, "Mom, did you know that if you just stare at a girl for a really long time, then you just fall in love."  
"No, I had no idea.  Does this happen to you Quinn?" I ask.
"No" he says, "I usually just fall in love with boys, but, well, actually there is this one girl Diana that I love." 
"Oh? Is she pretty?"
"Yeah."
"What does she look like?"
"She has an oval head."
Well that is great.  I guess your standards aren't very high in Sr. Kindergarten if an oval head is the only prerequisite required to pass for beauty.  I'm sure this kid is beautiful, I haven't met her yet.  All the kids were pretty cute and sweet on the first day though.  I'm pretty excited to meet this Diana that has stolen my son's heart I have to say.

As part of our day's adventures, we needed to swing by the high school today to drop off Jordy's forgotten lunch.  Poor kid didn't even know she forgot it until her friend Jordan told her.  Cael, Quinn and I happened to run into Jordynn's friend Jordan, and she stopped me while running to her next class.  She had a big smile on her face and stopped to have a quick chat.  I felt so good leaving that place.  A wire brush couldn't have wiped the smile from my face.  I would have thought that any "mom sightings" would be avoided like the plague, especially with little brothers in tow... but no, again I got that same welcoming feeling from Jordynn's friends today that I received on [orientation day](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/08/29/big-day-for-jordy-proud-day-for-mom/).  To top things off, I was a hero with Jordy when she got home off the bus.  Big thank you's and hugs came my way.  On the same vein, just last night when I got Quinn off the bus, Jordynn's friend from next door stayed outside to keep me company while the boys rode around on their bikes.  Her and I had a chat for about 45 minutes.  Just her and I.  I hope I never lose this connection with these kids.  They have so much to offer, and I could just eat their budding senses of humour.  God love them.  They are all good kids for sure.

I know this is another marathon post, but damn! I just love these kids so bear with me here... 

Part of our plan to enjoy this rainy day was to head over to Rockin' Johnny's for lunch.  We are eating ...again...and between mouthfuls of lunch Quinn pulls out this next gem...
"Mom, when I grow up and get a house all alone, please follow me.  That way I will always have you."  I tell him, "Sure baby, that sounds just fine by me."  Ahh, so sweet...here's where Cael throws in the comic relief though, "Mommy!" Picture the hands opening and closing as fast as possible while he talks, "When I grow up and live in a trailer, don't follow me..Kay!"  
"Are you going to live in a house and then holiday in your trailer?" I ask.
"Nope, just live in my trailer." he says.
"Can I come and visit?" I ask.
"YEP!"
Ok then.  Good.  I guess.  No one is fighting over me with this plan in place.

So if you have managed to get this far down my long post, thanks for sticking with it, and letting me share with you the little rays of sunshine I've been blessed with today.

May they never grow up, and their hearts always stay pure!
Nik
