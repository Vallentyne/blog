Since my brain is good for nothing today but riding around in my skull, awash in echoes of last night's Stompin' Tom show (which was awesome), I will unleash the following cuteness tsunami on you.
First, the dwarf miniature pony is the logical answer to the purse dog.Â  Standing about the size of the average cat, this is a [frigging small horse](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1205022/Koda-born-health-problems-doctors-worried-But-turns-hes-just-little-horse.html).Â  Suitable for domestic work such as plowing your kids sandbox, and jumping over entire juice boxes.Â  More good pictures at that link.

Next up we have a couple of pictures from [National Geographic Magazine](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/photography) (which has incredibly good pictures) one of which has been making the rounds on the interwebs.Â  It's an accidentally hilarious shot of an inquisitive squirrel hogging all of the attention.Â  They had set their camera up for a timed shot of themselves and nosy-pants decided to get in on the action.Â  Friggin prima donna....

I love this one of a bear fishing, it looks exactly like a guy in a fur suit with a comically over-sized head.

I wouldn't mention that to the bear's face mind you.

There you go, that should keep you til Monday.
