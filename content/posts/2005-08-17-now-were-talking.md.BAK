I posted earlier today about the complete and utter lack of sweet caffeine in Mountain Dew here in Canada.  Well, timing being everything, [this little link](http://www.energyfiend.com/death-by-caffeine/) came across Metafilter tonight, and now I know that if I could buy genuine American Mountain Dew, I could drink just over 192 cans of it before I died from a caffeine overdose.  Strangely, it would take 258 cans of Dr. Pepper to get the job done.  And (fortunately I guess) it would take 2350 cans of Decaffeinated Lemon Tea Snapple to ice me.  

I will leave the groaning denouement up to you for that parting pun.  What?  Sue me, I posted this under Stupidity, what do you expect?
