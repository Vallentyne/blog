I'm late to the party on this one, as usual, but man it's too good not to post.  Stephen Colbert of the excellent Colbert Report (son of The Daily Show) was a speaker (MC?) at the White House Press Correspondents dinner and he made the most of his time, let's say.  He let loose with a blistering sarcastic barrage of criticism of President Bush, while the man himself sat at the same table.  It's epic in proportion, and deserves recognition as possibly the most courageous bit of comedy in a long long time.  

Links to this and comments are everywhere, but here's the thing itself on the wonderful YouTube.

A comment here on how mainstream media [carefully avoided reporting on the whole thing](http://news.yahoo.com/s/huffpost/20060501/cm_huffpost/020130;_ylt=A86.I2xvSVZE09gAKwv9wxIF;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMHVqMTQ4BHNlYwN5bnN1YmNhdA--).

Then check out the hastily assembled [ThankYouStephenColbert](http://thankyoustephencolbert.org/) website, with over 25000 "Thank Yous" so far.   

Do you think you can trust the press?
