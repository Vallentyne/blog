An interesting article, [The Tyranny of Email](http://www.w-uh.com/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html) which goes into how people can be obsessive about email checking and how to use it more effectively.  It sort of wanders off on how programming is only possible in three hour blocks of time, but still there are some good points to be made here.  Most of which I am guilty of by the way.

You might say that blogging is very near the same, or it is this week.

Anyway, not a bad read.

oh and Andrea?  POST!!!!  damn you woman, are you working today or something?
