Wilson sent me a link to a [good article](https://mail.vallentyne.com/owa/redir.aspx?URL=http%3a%2f%2fnews.independent.co.uk%2fworld%2famericas%2farticle3353777.ece) about the legacy that Bush is leaving for the next president next year.Â  With the economy, war on terror, human rights issues, illegal immigration, healthcare, environmental problems and climate change, the list of incredible blunders goes on and on.Â  It's going to get worse before it gets better.

What person in their right mind would want the job of President with this mess waiting for them?Â  Say it with me folks, man it's good to be Canadian.Â  Sure we elected a boring Prime Minister, but really, you have to agree that boring is better than plain old stupid any day.
