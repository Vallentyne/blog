Just a quick one here, I saw this on the [Discovery Magazine blog](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/10/06/words-fail/) (or one of their blogs). Â It's [breathtaking aerial photos](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/10/earth_from_above_comes_to_nyc.html) from all over the world. Â This one is from Fraser Island in Australia, which I particularly like since I was there once....

It's an awesome place, it makes me even madder that we had no real camera at the time (why did we not have a camera? Â I have no idea).
