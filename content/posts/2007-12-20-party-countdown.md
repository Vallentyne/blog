We are at T-2 to the Vallentyne Christmas Party and things are coming together nicely.  Get yer darn self to our place for some fun and frivolity.

Not that I condone this sort of thing, but I saw a little article that I thought would be appropriate to mention here.  A list of [the 5 greatest drinking stories in history](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/10558), from what might be the largest drink ever mixed (there is some argument that this record doesn't hold anymore) to the great London beer flood of 1814.  It's a great read, lots of fun.

One of the commenters there mentioned a great article about Andre the Giant's drinking exploits that I had [blogged about before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/01/30/think-youre-a-big-drinker/), that's a whole new level of consumption.

Of course folks if you do plan on pulling an Andre-style evening, you will not be driving yourself anywhere afterwards, except perhaps driving your fingers into your ears as you listen to my attempts at guitar playing.  Plan to stay, we have lots of room and it's more fun that way.

I saw the Mental Floss article on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com).
