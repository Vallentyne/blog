So, Cindy is now a year older, good thing too.  She is uncomfortably young compared to some of us, but no names need to be Wilsoned.  I mean Doucetted.  Sorry, mentioned.

It doesn't bother me though, no sirree.

It was a pretty good time on Friday, I must say.  Thanks in part to Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.  That must be the best new televised drinking aid of the millenium.  It lends itself very well to lowered laugh thresholds, reduced sensitivity to televised "Painful Occurrences"(tm), and increased sensitivity to mean and sacrcastic one-liners.  It should come with a warning label.

Anyway, that's all for now.
Later.
