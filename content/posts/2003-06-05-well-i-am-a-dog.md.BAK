Well, I am a dog person, no doubt about it.  I think they can be an excellent companion and friend.  But as much as I like dogs, there is no room on this planet for dogs that bite people.  Australians call dogs that bite people dingos, and shoot them.  (Ok so there might be a breed/genetic difference there, I'm ignoring that right now, ok?)  Big or small, makes no difference, but the big ones kill people, while the little ones get punted into traffic.  In response to your story, Ali I would not have hesitated to kick those dogs, as hard as I could, and let the bastard try to take you to court.

The problem isn't the dogs of course, it's the humans.
