Finally, technology has caught up with my needs as a consumer.  I thought for a long time that I would be hopelessly trapped with no solution to my problem.




No longer.




Witness the fruit protection revolution firsthands, my children.  I have seen the future and it comes in 9 colours.  [Bananaguard](http://www.bananaguarduk.com/index.htm) will save us all.




This is the most suggestive website you will ever visit that is still somehow work-safe.  I love it.
