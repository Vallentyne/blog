I saw [this article](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/01/10/4764730-ap.html) about how Mexico City is trying to have a world record recognized for the longest conga line of skaters.Â  They only managed 225 skaters, which is rather embarrassing.Â  Their rink is also shamefully teeny, only twice the size of a regular hockey rink.Â  I'm thinking this is a record that Ottawa could smash easily and forever, after all we do have the longest skating rink in the world.Â  How's this for a rink ([sourced from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rideau_Canal))?


<blockquote>The cleared length is 7.8 kilometres (4.8 miles) and has the equivalent surface area of 90 Olympic hockey rinks.</blockquote>


Those are Olympic sized rinks, folks, not regular rinks.Â  We could probably manage about oh I don't know maybe 15000 people in our conga line?Â  That's if the conga line was a straight one, imagine how many people we could get if it zigzagged....

The NCC should set their sights on this one, it would be lots of fun I bet.Â  And we could put those Mexico City people in their place.Â  Who skates in Mexico?
