Sorry for the lengthy absence, I fell off the blog wagon there.

Fortunately there are lots of things to talk about today though.Â  First off we have an incredibly cool picture of a golden ray migration off the coast of Mexico, thousands of rays moving through the water.Â  Incredible.

It reminds me of that [Jellyfish Lake](http://www.neatorama.com/2007/05/20/jellyfish-lake/) I [posted about](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/05/30/what-the-heck-is-it-with-animals-anyway/) a little while back, similarly beautiful and deadly.

Post title is a little ADHS bonus.Â  You know who you are.
