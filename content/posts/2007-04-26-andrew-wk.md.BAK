Ah, sometimes there's just nothing like sitting down to a butt-numbing days work with the sweet [words of Andrew W.K.](http://www.azlyrics.com/a/andrewwk.html) in your ears.Â  Truly a poet for today's world:


<blockquote>

You work all night (all night)
And when you work you don't feel all right
And we,
When things stop feeling all right (all right)
And everything is all right

'Cos we will never listen to your rules (no)
We will never do as others do (no)
Know what we want and we get it from you
Do what we like and we like what we do

So let's get a party going (let's get a party going)....etc.</blockquote>

Yep, that says a lot.Â  If you think there's nothing actually in there, you're just not listening hard enough.Â  And if the lyrics don't seem to make sense, just turn it up a little louder.
