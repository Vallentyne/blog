Think you were a badass partier in your youth? Â Nuh-uh. Â Not so fast there, bucky. Â You have never partied harder than this:


<blockquote>20 year old Laura Hall is banned from buying alcohol in the entire country of England and Wales, and banned from every bar and pub in the **entire nation**. Â [Link](http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821990-laura-hall-given-drinking-banning-order-across-england-and-wales)</blockquote>


She wins, folks. Â Unless someone else can take it up a notch and terrorize an entire continent? Â Also, her parents must be tremendously proud.

On a completely unrelated note, my Mom must also be tremendously proud since her unemployed son hasn't even really bothered to blog anything of substance for weeks....
