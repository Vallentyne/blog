I guess the police in Texas are tired of waiting for drunks to be drunk outside the bar, and have started [arresting drunk people inside the bar](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11965237/from/RS.1/).  It's not legal to be drunk in public of course, so this makes sense I guess.  They are trying to protect people from hurting themselves and others, before they drink and drive, or step in front of a bus or something.

It just seems wrong somehow doesn't it?  I'm not sure why this strikes me that way, it must hit me in my liver or something.  My mis-spent youthful self would be outraged, but my doddering, tired, 3 beer is the limit, middle-aged self is shaking a mental stick and thinking; "Good for them!  Those young'uns shouldn't be out having any fun!  Arrest them all, I say! In my day we didn't have beer, we had boot polish.  Where do you think the term "Polished off another one" came from, anyway?  I need a nap."
