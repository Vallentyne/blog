I have mentioned Good Neighbour Jim a few times [before ](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2003/05/by_the_way_good.html)and his weakness for ridiculous outdoor activities.  It seems that despite good progress recently, he had a little setback and managed to find himself enrolled in the mother of all adventure races, a ridiculous 10 day, 400 mile trek in Utah.

Anyway, I guess we will have to support him, and hope he can kick this habit some other day....

They are now a little over 2 days into the race and Jim and his team are in 43rd spot, out of 84 teams still in the race, very respectable.  Check out the most impressive race coverage site: [www.ecoprimalquest.com](http://www.ecoprimalquest.com).  You can plot Jim's team (TnT Canada) via GPS locator on the race map, it's very very cool.  Sign the guestbook and lend some much needed encouragement to these guys, they will get the comments along the race as they go.  Way to go, neighbour.
