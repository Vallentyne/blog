Here's a shocker.

If we are to believe this news story, some guy dressed in a wool sweater wore his nylon coat to work, and became a walking lightning strike, setting his workplace on fire as he walked by.  The fire dept. was called when the fumes from the smoking carpet were detected.  Strangely, he never noticed any of this until he almost set his car on fire when asked to evacuate by the firefighters.  Apparently his coat had generated 40000 volts...

It seems a little far-fetched, don't it?  I mean wouldn't he notice every single hair on his body standing on end?  Even if he were bald, it would be a little noticeable to have to continually slick down his eyebrows, wouldn't it?  I mean everybody would be thinking he was angry, or something.  

Here's a link, see if you believe it:
