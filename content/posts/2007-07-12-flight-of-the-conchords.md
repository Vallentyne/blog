Nikki and I happened to catch the Flight of the Conchords a few nights ago and we were completely blown away by how good it is.  As far as I can tell from just one episode the idea is like this:  basically a very good sitcom about two guys from New Zealand living in New York, with utterly hilarious nerd hip-hop and folk music thrown into the middle of each episode.  You just have to see it to understand it.

To that end, here's one of their better raps:

There's lots [more here](http://www.hbo.com/conchords/video/index.html), but I'm tearing myself away from that site so I don't spoil the other episodes I haven't seen yet.  There's also lots of stuff on YouTube from their stand-up comic days if you look for it.  Be sure to check it out, you won't be sorry.
