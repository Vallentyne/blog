Some of the lads from the Trailer Park Boys are returning to TV in a new series, which will probably come as a relief to nobody but Nikki and I.

The show description almost defies belief:


<blockquote>Mike Smith, Robb Wells and J.P. Tremblay of _Trailer Park Boys_ have been cast to play multiple characters in a new Showcase series called _The Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour_ .

The series will centre on the cast of a fictional children's show, played by Smith, Wells and Tremblay, who accidentally ingest an addictive hallucinogen mixed by a character played by Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson.

As the series unfolds, the characters will contend with the bizarre cast of hallucinating children's show characters, a dysfunctional crime family that runs the town and a dangerous cult.</blockquote>


Wow.Â  That certainly should cover most of the comedy ground they are already familiar with.Â  I am personally looking forward to seeing these guys do something besides the characters they are known for.Â  It should be interesting to watch, at least.
