Some random thoughts on the family today.

Just when you think you have reached a balance with the kids, they throw something at you that wrecks it all.   Why do they do that?  It's one of those laws of nature, I guess.  There have been a few of those recently, I won't go into them here.

Nikki has lately been taking great pleasure in planting subliminal messages in Jordy's brain while she is sleeping.  I'm not kidding.  When we go to kiss the kids before bed, Nikki will plant suggestions in Jordy's mind about what colour of shirt to wear the next day, or how to wear her hair.  The messed up part is; it seems to work.  Jordy has more or less been obeying these suggestions over the last few days.  How diabolical is that?  I think Nikki is now drunk with power, and she's working up to getting Jordy to actually wear a skirt.  I think she should push for getting her to do a 'hawk for school.  Let the Catholic board think about that one.

I suppose that Nik can be forgiven, since she is hard up for entertainment at home everyday with the kids.  She has started measuring time in baskets of laundry, which is a sure sign of altered reality.

As for the children themselves, Quinn and Cael inch ever closer towards existing without pissing the other one off every second.  It's a long road.  Jordy has started her horse riding lessons, much to her delight.  Not so much for Nikki and I.  Through a mutual agreement I won't be taking Jordy to the lessons myself, what with the allergies and the death and the dying hey hey hey.  But that means that Nik takes her, and it turns out that she does her fair share of sneezing there.  Not to mention that she is a teensy bit intimidated by the horses, and a whole lot intimidated by the barn spiders, which according to her are basically ready to saddle and taken for a canter around the paddock.  So that's a bit of a drag for her, to say the least.

As for Harvey, well, he seems to just do his thing.Â  He's universally liked by all dogs, somehow.Â  Even the mean ones.Â  It must be the utter lack of aggression, I suppose.Â  I'm sure I taught him that.

That's it for today.
