I rode the bus in this morning and having finished my book last night I found myself with nothing to do.  So like any self-respecting geek I hauled out the laptop and wrote this on the bus.  Few things can identify you as a geek as quickly as typing on a laptop on a bus, but I guess Iâ€™m ok with that, given the fact that I write on this blog is sort of an easy tell that I might have geeky tendencies.

Thereâ€™s a good article on [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/02/bird_flu/) that talks about how a global flu pandemic is almost as sure as sneezes are wet, the question is just when it will happen.  The author makes a pretty good case, given the bird or avian flu is already around, it will only take a very small mutation to make that one a very big problem.  So you may wonder why I bring that up right at this moment as I bounce along on public transit?  Well, it because Iâ€™m sneezing my frickinâ€™ head off due to my allergies at the moment and Iâ€™m probably making the person next to me nervous.  I just forgot to take some allergy medicine, but for all they know Iâ€™m patient zero for the next global killer virus.  Thereâ€™s no point trying tell them that Iâ€™m probably harmless.  Itâ€™s hard to be convincing arguing that point when your head canâ€™t seem to stop whipping front and back from the punishing sequential chain sneezing.  In fact itâ€™s hard just making eye contact at that point.

Ok, so Iâ€™m exaggerating slightly, but still Iâ€™m sitting here sniffling mightily to keep the snot at bay and its darned inconvenient, unattractive, and annoying.  But at least with the laptop people know Iâ€™m just a nerd with allergies, and not the guy who escaped from quarantine.
