Hey, hey now! I'll be the first to admit I had a bad (very, very bad, actually) first outting with a pathetic time of 2 hours to get to work, but in my very next time out I shaved more than 45 mintues off of that time. I think we were at work in 1:12 minutes, and I still had lots left in the ol' gas tank. I attribute the faster time to actually eating before-hand...that and putting some air in my tires. I think we're going tomorrow and Friday, so it remains to be seen which day was actually the fluke.
