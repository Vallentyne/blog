Ha!  So.  I beat the odds and managed to keep a surprise from Nikki.  I had tickets for Blue Rodeo and she didn't know until I gave her the tickets at dinner on Valentine's Day.  Well, well.  Look who's Mr Vallentyne now, eh?

Anyway, all cockiness aside we had a nice evening and it turned out great.  That's a good thing.

As for us, well what is there to say?  We are still skating, the rink is better than ever.  I hope I don't look back on all of this rink making and regret it terribly in the spring when the basement is flooded...  I don't know exactly but I would bet that the sheet of ice in the backyard is approaching 6-7 inches thick, 65 feet long, 27 feet wide.  What's that, almost 900 cubic feet?  That's a lot of water.  You don't suppose that will melt all at once, do you?

Nah.

Stay tuned for the Welcome in the Spring Sandbagging party, probably around the end of March.  It will be a blast, I promise.

Later.
