As some of you know I am probably more likely to be classified as an "early adopter" of technology than some. I have a few devices that play music that is stored digitally around the house, and I really like them a lot. I caught [this story](http://news.com.com/When+iPod+is+the+DJ%2C+watch+out/2100-1041_3-5325135.html?tag=st_lh) on how people think their iPods have a music preference for one type of music or another when set to "shuffle". It's silly really. But... I must say that sometimes there does seem to be a strange association with the way songs come on at just the right moment.  For instance:

When Quinn has done something bad and I'm in the process of chasing him around the kitchen, inexplicably Jerry Reed's "Eastbound and Down" comes on, from Smokey and the Bandit.

Or just as I'm about to kiss Nikki whatever is on is suddenly interrupted with Barry White.

I'm sure it's all a coincidence.
heh heh.
right.
