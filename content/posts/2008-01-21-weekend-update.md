Nikki had a little weekend away as we do every 3 or four months.Â  It's a big part of staying sane and together for us, I would highly recommend it especially for those of you with kids.Â  Anyway, I won't bore you with the details of us being lazy and eating and drinking (although I highly recommend [Vittoria Trattoria](http://www.vittoriatrattoria.com/market/) which we enjoyed tremendously), we saw a couple of movies which I thought I would share with you.

First off we saw [P.S. I Love You](http://psiloveyoumovie.warnerbros.com/), which is a chick flick of the highest order, but with a couple of notable things.Â  First off, it wasn't ridiculously sappy.Â  It was sad sure, but they made it with a good dose of humour that I appreciated.Â  Secondly, they made very good use of some pretty good music that was integral to the story.Â  The main character was an Irish guitar player and singer, so there was a classic Pogues song at his funeral, and happily they had a fun Steve Earle song (Galway Girl) for a key scene in a bar.Â  So, guys you can probably stand this one, I did and survived to tell the tale.

Secondly, I then made Nikki come with me to see [Cloverfield](http://www.cloverfieldmovie.com/), which was clearly her penance for taking me to see P.S. I Love You.Â  Not to say that this was a bad movie, we both agreed that the parts we actually saw were very good.Â  The problem was the decision to have the "handheld camera" effect for the entire movie.Â  It was meant to add realism and grittiness and, for Nikki especially, it added nausea and not much else.Â  It was kind of frustrating since this is a really fun monster movie, when you can figure out what they are trying to show you.Â  I enjoyed it more than Nikki, but really I don't think that the movie was any better for the camera effects.Â  Indeed, when they make the sequel (and they will, that much is clear from the lack of answers in the first one) I hope they abandon that part and show us the good stuff with some clarity.Â  They really came up with a great story, or what little they decided to show us, I think there's lots of story left to tell.

So there you go, movie reviews for ya.
