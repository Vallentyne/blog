I was not in the least surprised to see this article on the Ottawa Citizen site today that says while Ottawa folks are pretty healthy, the regions just 20 minutes east are among the worst in Ontario for heart disease and stroke.


<blockquote>"Renfrew County is developing a reputation as the regionâ€™s stroke capital because a quarter of residents are smokers, and nearly one in five suffer from high blood pressure, the strongest risk factor for stroke."</blockquote>


The smoking thing is something I have really noticed, there sure seems like a lot of smokers out that way.Â  Not to mention the article says that two thirds of the residents of the Eastern townships are overweight....Â  holy poutine, Batman!Â  Two thirds?Â  That's insane.
