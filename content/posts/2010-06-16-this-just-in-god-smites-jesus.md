An enormous 62 foot tall statue of Jesus that the Ohio locals called "Touchdown Jesus" for obvious reasons was smoten recently by lightning and burned entirely, revealing our new lord Clippy, the helpful wire character from MS Office 97.

It seems that the folks at the church are taking this fairly seriously, you might even go as far as to call this a "sign".

Also, perhaps I ought to be a tad more careful about mocking our new wireframe saviour. Â In God's defence, it does SORT of look like Jesus is waiting for something to come from the sky, maybe he just has a sense of humour.

Um, I'm done now.

Saw this tonight on [Boing Boing](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/w92nL8LEssA/lightning-strikes-ma.html).
