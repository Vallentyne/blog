With the Christmas season past, and New Year's looming, it's time to set (unrealistic) resolutions (that are predestined to fail)!Â  My resolutions this year are as follows (in no particular order):



	  * be 5 inches taller by this time next year
	  * write a bestselling book about how I became a world famous cribbage star in just six months by winning the 24th Annual CribCage (of Death) Match in Venezuela.
	  * turn 28 on my birthday this year
	  * have the best lawn on my street
	  * transcend time and space and become omnipotent

It's the same list as last year, except for the birthday part.Â  I actually did turn 29 last year, give or take a couple thousand days.

That list isn't getting any shorter (although if I manage the last one, I can stop time and that makes the other ones a LOT easier to get done.Â  A nice lawn takes a while to get just right.), so I had better get on it early.

Anyway, if I get nothing else done on my list, I'm sure that I can at least accomplish what this lazy guy can do.Â  I mean come on!Â  He still has to _hang onto the bar_ to do his gravity defying thing, pfft.Â  What a lard arse.

Seriously though, that's some amazing fitness right there.Â  I saw this video on [Steve Edward's blog](http://steve-edwards.blogspot.com/2009/12/feats-of-strength.html) (one of the P90X creators) and while I will never be able to do any of this stuff without being able to stop time to let me workout 6 extra hours each day, maybe I will be able to at least find my abs again at some point this year.

Any other resolutions I should add to my list?
