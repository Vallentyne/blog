Feverish preparations have prevented me from my usual run-up to this years VCB, the tedious teasers, the unnecessary play by play, etc.  So I am only able to say this:  Are you ready to ROCK?  Get out your fringe jacket, aviators, and cowboy boots because you only have just over one day to get stoked for the rockinest party this side of the Appalachians.  Chill your malt liquor, children.  Dust off your liver because you may need that, too.

I will say this:  You will experience Christmas spirit like no other.  You might think [these people](http://media.putfile.com/WizardsofWinter-SM) have spirit (or just a lot of time on their hands), but they gots nuttin on us!

Are you locked?  Loaded?  Online?  Good, now get over to our place, pronto.  Or in 29 hours, rather.  Giddyap.

P.S. VCB=Vallentyne Christmas Bash
