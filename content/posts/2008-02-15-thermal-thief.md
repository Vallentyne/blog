Nikki suffers from a medical condition known as TDE or thermal deficiency in the extremities. It's a common condition, runs in her family actually. It means that she ALWAYS has cold hands and feet. We are talking really cold, cryogenically cold. I can't imagine something that cold belonging to a warm-blooded creature, it's unnatural.

Anyway, predictably I am the target for all of her heat-seeking tendencies. In bed her freakishly cold feet seek my legs out, thermo-kinetically drawn to me as a heat source. I don't stand a chance against those heat-dementors. Her bloodless, clutching undead toes seek out my warm flesh and mercilessly drain me of all heat and happiness.Â  Well, happiness is an exaggeration, but it's darn cold and not much fun sometimes.Â  It's a strange dichotomy that Nikki's personality is so warm and giving, while her feet are actually heat seeking wind-chill demons with a mind of their own.

Anybody else know someone like this?
