Hey kids.

Sorry to geek out on you for a bit here, but it looks like there will be a very good [lunar eclipse](http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/LEmono/TLE2007Aug28/TLE2007Aug28.html) happening early tomorrow morning.  It seems that the [weather ](http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/pages/on-118_metric_e.html)will cooperate, and the time to check in our area is shown very nicely in this little NASA graphic:

That's tad early, but I might toddle out in my jammies if I wake up on time.Â  So there you go.Â  Wilson, I expect some pictures of this event.
