Just when you think things are weird enough, they get a lot weirder.

Remember when [I noted](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/10/26/squicky-surgery/) that apparently there is a demand for eyelash transplants for those who insist on longer, thicker eyelashes, even at the cost of having to trim them like the hair on your head?  Well it seems that the inevitable and logical end to this trend is here:  extraordinarily long false eyelashes [are the rage in Japan](http://www.wgal.com/slideshow/entertainment/13358621/detail.html).  I mean really long.  Like fur.

Man that's weird.

I saw this on Table of Malcontents a little while ago, and stole the picture from there too.....
