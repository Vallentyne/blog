I'm just going to leave this here.

[Severed Feet Keep Washing up on Pacific NorthWest Shores](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/11/severed-feet-still-inside-shoes-keep-mysteriously-washing-up-on-pacific-northwest-shores/)

I have [noticed ](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/02/18/left-foot-check-right-foot-crap-not-again/)this story [before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/05/26/the-other-shoe-has-dropped/), and yep it's still weird. Â I used up all my puns on those two blog posts (I even made a hokey-pokey one), I really have nothing LEFT (ok I still amuse myself with these things at least). Â A really strange coincidence is that almost all of the feet were wearing running shoes.Â  Exercise kills, people.

16 feet since 2007. Â I'm gonna keep my feet in Ontario, I think. it's slightly less weird.
