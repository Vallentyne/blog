Here's a really really mundane post.

Go and find your copy of The Tragically Hip's Up To Here.Â  It's next to the TV, in that huge CD rack, at the bottom, between ABBA Gold and that Tone Loc CD.Â  Put it in your stereo and listen to [Boots or Hearts](http://www.thehip.com/Discography.html?LyricID=14&AlbumID=2&SongID=14&SearchAction=viewResults&detail=basic&CheckIT=2_14#2_14) up nice and loud.Â  Pay close attention to the guitar in the right speaker.Â  Listen to that excellent sliding acoustic lead by Robbie Baker, wonderful and fresh to this day.Â  Man, that was a great piece.Â  It's a spare, clean and soulful performance.Â  The lyrics are also excellent and clever.Â  The Hip don't make songs like that one anymore.Â  I have fallen off as a fan as the years went by, but I remember hearing that song and wishing I could play like that.Â  I still wish that.

That's all I have for the moment.
