It was brought to my attention that my previous post may have led some people to believe that it is Nikki that is incontinent.  Let me clarify that this is not the case, Quinn is the one that is now obsessed with roadside relief.

Funny how that sentence sounded just fine in my head....

Sorry for any confusion this may have caused, and many thanks to everyone who sent over the adult diapers.
