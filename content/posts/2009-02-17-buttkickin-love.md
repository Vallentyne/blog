Yesterday was "Family Day" which means for us that the kids stay home with Nikki while I go to work anyway.Â  Still we had a nice family dinner planned since we were all apart this weekend to our various activities; Nikki and I had a weekend to ourselves in Gananoque, Jordy was at her Dad's place with a bunch of girlfriends, and the boys had a holiday at Nanny's.Â  So we celebrated Vallentyne's Day together last night, and it was great. It's nice how even though all of our separate weekends did not go completely smoothly, we pulled it together and had a nice time in spite of it all.

Cael summed it all up nicely a few days ago.Â  He was eating his dinner (slowly as only a 5 year can) and hamming it up as usual, and he made a fist and smacked his other palm a few times and said in his best "old geezer" voice (which involves adopting a toothless expression that words do not do justice) "Who wants some buttkickin' love?"

Indeed.
