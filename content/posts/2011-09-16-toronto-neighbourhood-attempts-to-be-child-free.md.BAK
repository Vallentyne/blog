Here's a link to a CBC Radio program that has an interview with a childless couple from the downtown neighbourhood of Liberty Village that is trying to get a bylaw passed that would prevent couples from buying a home in the 4 block area immediately surrounding their own home.Â  I wish them luck in their efforts to rid themselves of screaming rugrats.

###### Note that the program is completely satirical, making funÂ of cold ridiculous yuppie snobs.Â  It's done pretty well, the comments are about 50% between people who get it and people who really don't. Also, good for you for zooming in to read this.
