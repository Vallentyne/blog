Hellloooooooo!  

I can't remember the last time I posted a blog.  Forgive me people for simply enjoying your blogs and not contributing myself.  I have to get El Presidente Geeko man to post a picture of our sweet little dancer on the blog, as I am technically challenged and presently lack the skills necessary to do so (for now).  Our wee ballerina did an amazing job at her competition on Sunday morning at the Palais des Congress in Hull.  We don't know how they placed yet as we were sacked and couldn't last until the end.  We were up around 5 AM(ish)  to do hair and make up and be ready to check in at the competition at 7:00AM.  Blah blah, anyway will post her results once we get them.  This must be what a hockey mom feels like.  (I wouldn't trade it for the world either).




TPB party YEAH!  I'm looking forward to it.  I was considering making a reappearance for Corey but the jury is still out on that one.  We'll see.  Ali, you let us know how we can help with any prep work.  Let me know if there is anything here from the last TPB fest that you can make use of.  Also let me know if I can bring any JELL-A-PEN-OS chips too!
