I may have mentioned that Nikki is part fish now, she's turning into quite the swimmer.  So, that makes [this thing](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/swimp3-boneconducting-swimmers-music-player-024186.php) the perfect Christmas gift.  It's a waterproof MP3 player, it conducts the sound right through your skull so you don't need to wear headphones, in fact you actually wear earplugs to keep the water out (I guess that's a normal swimmer thing, makes sense to me).  Weird and cool.  And I know she wouldn't be caught dead wearing this thing at the pool because she would think it's too nerdy, so I won't really be buying it for her for Christmas.

This is targeted at the althletic computer nerd, I guess.  It's got to be a very small market.
