Teenagers.  WOW!  They a different animal all together when compared to the whole baby/toddler/elementary stage.  It's incredible the difference in the kids, and I swear it happens overnight.  It is a point where the young adults are realizing that they are (or should be in their mind) entitled to a few extra freedoms.  It is a time when parents need to release the death grip of instinctive protectiveness that has been in our job description since their birth.  Where and when do you find balance?  I'll tell you...every day.  Every day is different, and every day you have to reevaluate your opinion on what is age appropriate, what they can handle, and what is out there to hurt them.  Even if they can handle what they are asking to do...what dangers lurk that none of us have control over.  The world is a dangerous place, and although we can't live in fear...we must strike a balance.  Kids often refuse to see the danger, and focus on how responsible they are capable of being.  Two very different arguments as I know most parents will agree.

What have I learned from Jordy?  I'll can tell you, that she has turned me into a better person in her journey to adulthood.  Why?  Let me explain with a small and weak example (its just the only one I have at the ready);
Night before last Cael was struck with a painful ear infection.  We had a rather busy day that day with appointments and skating and recreation activity.  Tuesdays are insane at our house for kids stuff.  I'm in line just before closing at the drugstore counter to get the prescription filled and Jordy starts a conversation about make up and what the other kids are wearing vs what she is permitted to wear.  I look at her and say I want to keep an open mind, but I'm just drained for today, let's throw mom a bone and shelf this one for later.  So,...as any teenager would...the urge to continue is just too great...so it continues.  We get into the house, Cael is crying for his meds, and I'm lying in bed consoling him while he whimpers.   This is where I'm really impressed....Jordy comes in and kisses Cael, and cuddles him..she does everything she can think of to make him more comfortable.  When I get up to get a Kleenex she follows me and says, "I'm sorry mom, I shouldn't have bugged you when you had all this to deal with too."   WOW!  Well done Jordy.  At the risk of dragging this post on longer than it needs to be, I feel that she deserves even more credit that the above (weak) example.

Jordy has always been the first to say she is sorry in any situation.  It's never an "I need to make this go away so I'll apologize" kind of sorry, or a sarcastic one either.  I've never known any adult, or kid, give a more sincere apology than her.  She will come on her own, look you in the eye and say she is sorry and exactly what she is sorry for.

She's a bigger person than I've ever been able to be....and I thank her for the life lesson.  I admire that in her, and there is no greater pride than to learn from your kids, and see that they have developed skills beyond your own.
