Permit me to rant for just a moment, if you will.

Got the girls' cell phone bill last week, opened it and was unpleasantly surprised to see it was about double what it normally is.Â  Further analysis revealed that the extra charges were from mobile browsing, almost $50 for each phone.Â  Wow, that's a lot of mobile browsing, you might say.Â  You would be wrong.Â  The amount of data for each phone was less than a megabyte, in fact.Â  Let's put that into perspective here: that much data would fit onto a floppy disk, if you remember what those are.Â  Â  The rate for this charge was there in black and white:Â  $51.20/MB

I can't be the only one thinking that's a little excessive, when (as I found out) you can get an all-you-can browse plan for $3/month?Â  Even at 3G speeds (and these phones aren't 3G), my iPhone plan with Rogers is $30 for 6GB/month.Â  That's a half a cent/MB folks, or approximately 5000 times cheaper.Â  I understand they want to drive people to use their data plans, and pay for capacity they aren't using, but this smacks of robbery to me.

Needless to say I called to complain about the charges and to Bell's credit they reversed the charges for me, but only because I don't complain often.

What gives?
