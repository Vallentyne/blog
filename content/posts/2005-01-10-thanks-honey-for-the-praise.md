Thanks honey for the praise.
Being that I sent that email to Courtney during the work hours of Friday afternoon, there was one more deed that was not yet checked off the "to-do" list.  I did manage to fulfill the list with the help of "partner in crime" Cindy however at approximately 11:30PM Friday night.  Just under the mark of midnight the final task of the day was complete.

-1 toilet papering of GN Jim's SUV.
-2 rolls of toilet paper used.
-2 very giddy girls running in the house to grab digital camera

I should probably add that this was Cindy's suggestion in October or November of 2004 (to which I laughed a hardy laugh and agreed) and it took us this long to work up the nerve to do it.
