My my, time flies when you're nuts.

What's new folks?  Well I'll tell you what's new.

We put a major bee on this month to get the basement drywalled.  I have Robbie and Kyle to thank for that, they did the heavy lifting for scrawny old me to run the drill.  Much appreciated, and you guys know you banked a big favour there.  As a matter of fact the mud/tape guy just started working in the basement today to finish it all off this week, with luck.  Very exciting.  Well, it is for me.

Also, Nikki and I have been alternating doing the painting in Jordy's new room.  We did 2 coats of blue from floor to ceiling, measured and marked off the stripes, and put three coats of yellow on those.  This week will be applying a glaze to all of this that will hopefully finish the painting of the walls once and for all.  Then it's put up the chair rail and paint the trim.  That's a lot of painting in one room, folks.

Also, I have cleaned out the garage (that was a while coming), and put up the Christmas lights.  Soon it will be decorate the inside of the house for Christmas.  It's all about the chores lately.

But that's not what I came to tell you today.  I had the pleasure of seeing John Prine at the NAC on Thursday (the 20th).  It was a real treat, let me tell you.  There's a guy who can hold my attention forever.  He's a great combination of humour and good songwriting.  I urge you to give him a listen yourself.  His website and record company is [OhBoy.com](http://www.ohboy.com).  Or you can email him yourself at johnprine@ohboy.com

If it wasn't too late to get my letter to Santa, I might ask for "[The Full Johnny](http://www.ohboy.com/compstore/ohboy.htm#)".

Later kids.
