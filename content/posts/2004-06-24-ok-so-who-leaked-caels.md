Ok, so who leaked Cael's story to the press?

[Mutation Creates SuperKid
](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/24/1234250)

And the Star also [picked up the article](http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1088028614059&call_pageid=968332188854&col=968350060724).

They think we live in Germany, but the rest of the details are the same.  Except for the "half the body fat of other kids his age" bit.  And the "bulging muscles" bit.

You know how the media distorts the truth sometimes....
