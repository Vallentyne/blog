In my daily trawl through the web, I usually find something noteworthy on Neatorama.Â  They have a great bunch of authors there and usually find something worth pointing out to you.Â  This is no exception.Â  Check out this extreme closeup of a dragon fly covered in dew.Â  Perfection, and very cool looking.Â  Check out the author's other nice shots [here](http://photo.net/photodb/member-photos?user_id=2109438).

I have only one comment on this wonderful image.Â  Is anybody else besides me totally bothered by how freaking WET this poor bastard is?Â  Imagine being that wet, and it's just not going anywhere.Â  It doesn't drip off you, it won't dry until the sun comes around and burns it off.Â  You probably can't fly because you weigh 4 times what you normally do.Â  Shaking probably does nothing, because when you are that small the surface tension of water probably makes it more like glue than anything else.Â  How utterly annoying.Â  And then you get this huge guy sticking a camera in your face, which you can only just make out through the water drops on your huge eyes.Â  No wonder bugs bite us.
