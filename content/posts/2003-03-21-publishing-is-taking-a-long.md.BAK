Publishing is taking a long time, there should be better response from this but it ain't quite there yet.  So Wilson and his dissin took a bit longer to show up than usual.

You should be nicer to me though, since I can edit everyone's posts.  That's censorship for ya, it's good to be the censor and not the censee.

Don't worry though, I wouldn't edit anything on you guys.  That's just mean.
