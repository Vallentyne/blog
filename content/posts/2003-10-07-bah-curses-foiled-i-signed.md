BAH!  Curses!  Foiled.

I signed the bbcanada.com website that features the Manoir (Hosted-by-Be-atch) Mon Calme only to be edited out moments later.  I must say they have a dedicated editing staff as I reposted at least 5x after getting snuffed out.  I even contacted the website via email to ask why the hell am I allowed to post only "good" things, when bad experiences do ACTUALLY happen?  I outlined to them _politely_ that I thought this proved to be misleading to other users.  I got a reply from them immediately stating that, being they are like a phone book, no negativity is allowed.  I guess we are bound to the ever so popular blog for bashing, uh, I mean educating others.

Anyway, no need to harp on the past as the weekend turned out just fine otherwise.  It just burns me that she blamed her English as not being her strong point, and maybe we misunderstood.  SHE'S IN TOURISM!!!!  You would think that she would want to work on that.  I'm sure they are hoping to pay the bills with more than just French speaking travelers.

There, I'm done.  Who wants a piece of me now?!?!?!??!?!
