Well let me just start by saying a great big THANK YOU to everyone who remembered and doted upon our Little Man Cael for his 4th birthday.Â  He is a happy and healthy four year old, and we couldn't be more grateful and proud.

It's a bittersweet occasion, and I think I can safely speak for Courtney too when I say that we just can't believe how quickly the time went.Â  It seems like only yesterday when I had a newborn and a toddler each occupying a spot on each hip, with a beautiful 7 year old ray of sunshine to compliment them both.Â  It's like the magic of movie makers where they can somehow cram a person's entire lifetime into a two hour film.Â  Yep, that's about how it feels.

So now Cael is four and he is learning social graces along with being more descriptive in his conversation...and sometimes more colourful.Â  That being said, we had a moment like that here this morning.Â  Yesterday little man had his birthday party with his friends and later had Godparents, family and friends in.Â  He opened a present from Auntie Whit which was received quite well.Â  It was a Sponge Bob Square PantsÂ  game called, "Ants In Your Pants".Â  He was very happy to see that and couldn't wait to play it.Â  So we agreed that today would be a better day to play that game seeing as we had company last night.

So after breakfast I'm getting ready to go through the toys and put in batteries and set up games when Cael comes up to me and says, "Hey Mom!Â  Let's play Hands in your Pants!"

Uh-huh.Â  Ok, well try and keep a straight face on that one.Â  Here's a sobering thought, picture him continuing to get this wrong (which he has despite my efforts all day)Â  and tells everyone he knows, and at school about this great new game he plays with his family.Â  Yeah, how long do you think before child services bangs down our door!Â  Sheesh, out of the mouthes of babes for sure.
