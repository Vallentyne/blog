Say what you will about Canada, stuff like [this](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/08/20/4432338-ap.html) just doesn't seem to happen all that often here.

The police in Florida were running a "Guns for Kicks" program where anyone can exchange a gun for $50 towards a pair of running shoes.  Apparently some guy walked in with a surface-to-air missile launcher (!) and exchanged it for $50 towards shoes for his daughter.  The "no questions asked" policy was definitely being pushed to the limit, I would say.
