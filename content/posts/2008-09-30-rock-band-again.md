I mentioned that Rock Band was cool [a few months ago,](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/08/05/rock-band/) but then Nikki and the kids gave it to me for my birthday and we have had some time to hone our skills quite a bit since then. Â It's great fun, the whole family enjoys it a lot and where else do your kids get to learn the words to Weezer, Soundgarden, The Ramones, the list of suggestive and inappropriate lyrics [goes on](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_in_Rock_Band). Â Nikki's eyebrows have disappeared upwards at times as Quinn tries to keep up with reading the lyrics. Â The latest favourite for the lads to do together is Mississipi Queen. Â If you know what I mean.

I find myself incapable of parental outrage at this, since I'm overwhelmed by some sort of twisted pride that my kids are getting exposed to some pretty good music, let alone learning the words. Â It's fun stuff, and there is a real sense of [learning to play the drums](http://videogames.suite101.com/article.cfm/learning_drums_through_rock_band) (if not the guitar) you get from the game. Â It's not as easy as it looks, and things get out of hand very quickly. Â Anyway, there is also a strong sense of showmanship that I must say that Cael is really figuring out. Â He's not so good with the technical side of actually playing the game and succeeding (there's usually a lot of "saving" going on), but when it comes down to pure entertainment, he's hard to beat. Â 

Don't believe me? Â Here's Rob, Quinn and Cael absolutely demolishing a song....
