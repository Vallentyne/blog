Hey.

Kent got a little spaced out there on us, that's ok.  That's ok.  It's his first time.  That's no reason to have an awkward silence, although that felt good to let him twist in the wind on that one for a while.  Anywho, I thought I would give you an idea of what the Quinnpox look like.

This is pretty good actually.  He looked worse yesterday when the pox were a lot redder and angrier.  I can't in good taste show you where the majority of the pox really are, but I will leave that to your imagination.  It hasn't been too fun, although I must admit that I did laugh when I saw him "scooting" in the tub, trying to itch those damn things.  I think that we might have had about 4 hours of sleep on Saturday night, and then on Sunday night we were in the ER for about 3 hours, I think I had 2 hours of sleep that night.  Nobody is too happy in that scenario.

Still I think we are on the mend now, we got a bit more sleep last night, and things are looking up.  See what you have to look forward to Andrea?  Only twice as bad?
