Go and read [this article](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/woman/story/0,,1959914,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=1) right now.Â  Go and don't come back until you're done.Â  I'll wait.

It's a very good bit on something that I know Nikki and I have been noticing for a while now; we are always tired.Â  When we aren't sleeping, we are getting worse at taking the time to relax.Â  We end up going hard, harder to get "there" and then completely shutdown for a spell.Â  It's not very healthy for sure.Â  We are in a period of going crazy now, getting the house ready for Christmas and shopping, etc.Â  Nikki has some jewelry shows too, and after those are done I'm sure we will collapse into a heap of dazed numbness.

The article covers lots about a culture of work and how nobody is allowed to show any perceived weakness for fear of losing their job.Â  Unfortunately for Nikki she has a lock on her particular job and isn't likely to be replaced soon...
Anyway, we could all stand to relax a bit more.Â  Give it a try, I know I'm going to hold Nikki down until she relaxes tonight.

P.S. That last sentence sure sounded better in my head than when I wrote it.Â  What I mean is I will threaten her with bodily violence if she doesn't smarten up and relax, dammit.Â  Yeah, that's better.
