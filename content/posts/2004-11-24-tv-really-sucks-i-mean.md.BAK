TV really sucks.

I mean sucking in every way, too. The shows are unwatchable, the service is too expensive, and the technology is reaching the breaking point. I know I'm not a spring chicken anymore, but I'm sure I must be in somebody's demographic target. Nikki and I watch exactly 0 hours of new programming each week on purpose.  We get some accidental exposure due to Jordy and the boys, but almost exclusively the Family channel.  Mostly it's Family Guy reruns, Simpsons reruns, Seinfeld reruns, you get the idea.  There are some exceptions for us, you all know what they are, Trailer Park Boys being the biggest one.

At first I thought it was just cable TV, but I'm hearing now that satellite TV sucks too from other folks.

Does anybody else notice the utter crappiness of TV land, or is it encroaching age and crotchetiness that makes me hate all things I used to like?
