Trying out some of the new Movable Type 3.2 features that are supposed to make it easy as pie to change the look of your blog, hope you like the new design.  I can't take credit for the actual design, but I can take credit for breaking the archives pages, they look like crap right now.  In fact pretty much every page except this one looks really bad at the moment.

I'm not sure why yet.  More to come.
