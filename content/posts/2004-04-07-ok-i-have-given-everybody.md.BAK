Ok, I have given everybody a break for a good long time now.  It's time to talk about the new season of Trailer Park Boys.  It starts on Sunday, 9pm on Showcase as usual.  This is the fourth season, and it should only get better from here.

Showcase.ca has some updated stuff on the show, some of it is quite good.  One thing they have is a characters section, with an actor's bio for each.  One thing I never noticed is that the actress playing Sarah is actually Jim Lahey's daughter.  Also, Randy still holds down a full-time job as a bottled water sales rep, if you can believe that.  Who would buy anything from that dude?

Anyway.

First episode description:
Never Cry Sh--wolf (my edit, not theirs):
Julian gets out of jail only to discover that Ricky is the new supervisor of Sunnyvale Trailer Park. Ricky and his assistant, Bubbles, have been carrying out various illegal activities.

absolute gold.
