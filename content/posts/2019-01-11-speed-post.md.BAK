After fixing some WordPress weirdness, I finally get into the new post form just after my flight starts boarding.  Boarding the fancy folks, at least.  Not regular folk like me who have to file to the back and just suck it up.







However, here I am.  Finally entering some real words on a real blog post?  One with words?  Well, as many words as I can enter in the 10 minutes I have before I get on a plane.  I haven't been blogging at all in the last while, spending most of my time on Twitter, which is a shame.  I miss writing real things here.  Or as real as I ever did.  Which was actually not much.  Silly joke filled incoherent crap.  But I enjoyed it, anyway.







So, I won't call it a resolution because that's dumb.  But rather an _intention _to write here more often than never, and try to write something meaningful.  In the end this is a vanity blog after all.  I mean if you go back through the years I have written about dogs, and kids and dumb things, but I haven't really touched anything meaningful, really.  







Not to say that I would expect much.  I mean I'm not a real writer.  And I'm definitely not one to share personal things, really.  I guess I will just write about whatever.  Maybe it will be work?  Maybe not.  Let's see.  The intention is to just write.  So, jeez buckle up for the old school blog, I guess.  Back when the Internet was capitalized.







See you soon, folks.
