Here's a neat idea.  It's a bit artsy-geek, but [TenbyTen.org](http://tenbyten.org/10x10.html) is fascinating.  It is (or so the site says) completely automatic, without human input.  It scans 3 newsfeeds every hour, and selects the top 100 words, along with the top 100 pictures.  It puts those up in a grid and lets you see what's happening in the world at the moment in a really neat way.  As you mouse over the pictures the corresponding words at the side are highlighted.  Same goes for the the words, the interface is excellent.




It's really trippy, and very cool.




Check it out.
