Check out these [body tricks](http://health.msn.com/menshealth/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100119940&GT1=7538), they sound really cool.  For example:



<blockquote>Forget Sudafed. An easier, quicker, and cheaper way to relieve sinus pressure is by alternately thrusting your tongue against the roof of your mouth, then pressing between your eyebrows with one finger. This causes the vomer bone, which runs through the nasal passages to the mouth, to rock back and forth, says Lisa DeStefano, D.O., an assistant professor at the Michigan State University college of osteopathic medicine. The motion loosens congestion; after 20 seconds, you'll feel your sinuses start to drain.</blockquote>



A little gross, maybe, but way cool nonetheless.  Check them out, there's lots more.

I saw this on [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com).
