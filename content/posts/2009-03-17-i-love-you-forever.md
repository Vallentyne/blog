Well after reading Court's blog about no content for a while, y'know what with that whole work thing getting in the way, I thought I would take a minute to contribute one of my rare posts. Now, let's see what EVER would I post about? ...Right.Â  Kids of course.

Here is a little taste of the young sweetness that I'm gratefully surrounded by.

**Let's start with our little ham Cael:**

Cael and I were talking and cuddling and he decided after a while that he wanted to head downstairs and play with some toys while I folded laundry.Â  Before going downstairs he paused on the top step towards the basement and says, "I love you forever mom."

To which I reply, "I love you forever too, Little Man."

"No like I REALLY love you, like forever and ever when we are dead and in our Heaven Suits!"

Kay, so now I'm REALLY curious.Â  I have to find out more about this.Â  So I say, "Heaven Suits huh?Â  What do our heaven suits look like?"

Cael looks at me like 'Are you kidding me?' and says, "Y'know, they're like blue dresses and we have that circle thing on our heads."

What canÂ  I say at this point, I should have known what this heaven suit looks like obviously, seems that everyone does according to Cael.Â  So I simply replied, "Oh, of course.Â  I love you in my heaven suit too."

**Then there is Quinn:**

Quinn is a more serious sort.Â  Not too serious, just a "one mood" kind of guy.Â  He's so easy going and takes everything in stride.Â  He loves to be loved up, and expresses himself conservatively, which is a bit of a contrast to his exuberant younger brother.Â  When he does throw you a bone though (and it happens often), you definitely know he means it and wants you to know how he feels.Â  So with that in mind, I'll share with you the bone he threw me recently.Â  He was in bed one night and I was tucking him in .Â  I was kissing his face and then proceeded to nibble on his ears while he giggled. Then he says, "Mom, please don't nibble on my ear."

He was giggling so I was confused by the request.Â  "Why do you want me to stop nibbling on your ears Quinn?"

Insert throwing of bone, "Because I can't hear all the beautiful things you have to say."

Well guess which one of us turned into a melted puddle.Â  I'll give you a hint....not Quinn.Â  What a doll.

**Our sweet and ever growing up Jordy:**

Last, but certainly not least, I have to share something about Jordy.Â  You may recall before how I was mentioning what a big person she is.Â  Well that continues on a daily basis. I learn from her a lot.Â  We all do.Â  She's got an old soul and a heart of gold.Â  The thing I guess I'm most grateful for is that she still wants to hang out with Mom sometimes.Â  We had given her a lot of room with managing her own workload, at her request...and it didn't go as smoothly as it could have.Â  She said later, it's better when we are on her about this stuff.Â  What kid would say, "yeah, you were right, I need you to help me."Â  This kid would.Â  We are pretty proud of her.Â  It is March break and she is staying in Cornwall until Thursday.Â  She asked me before she left, "Mom, can we do something just me and you on Thursday when I get back?"

Music to a mother's ears to hear her teenager choose to spend quality time with her.

This is one proud mom, signing off for now.Â  I've got some Green Rice Krispies to make and some Shamrock face painting to do!Â Â  I love March Break. I can't wait for summer holidays. :-)
