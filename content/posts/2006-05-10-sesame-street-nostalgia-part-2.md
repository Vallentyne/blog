More memories from the Street, just links this time since the embedded videos take forever to load because YouTube is kinda slow.

First we have REM singing [Furry Happy Monsters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkHM8xG6i8o), an excellent pop tune.  Then check out Stevie Wonder in his [funky glory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_SMnKr7uT0), seriously this is like some druggy 70's jam session.  The musical talent they got was very impressive, you don't see much of that today.

And then the killer killer classic bit: [Yep Yep Yep Nope Nope Nope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKX0RN19zc0).  That still makes me laugh.  The skill of the puppeteer, those guys and girls should have won Oscars for the performances.

These are stolen from a post on Metafilter and made me misty eyed.  Enjoy.  Don't forget [Part 1](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/05/sesame_street_n.html) in this fascinating series.
