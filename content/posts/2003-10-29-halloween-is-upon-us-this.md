Halloween is upon us.  This year (one-time blogger) Ali is having a little do at her place.  Nikki and I are not telling anybody what we are dressing up as, so there's no way you can make me tell here.  Nope.

The party should be an excellent time, I'm looking forward to it.

On the geek note, here is a really nifty site, the [Earth Observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16345) run by NASA.  Some way cool pictures there, the one I linked to is a shot of one of the solar flares recently.  Just amazing stuff.  If you're a geek that is.

As I said to Nikki last night, "The geek shall inherit the earth", so watch it.
