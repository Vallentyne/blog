First off, that "new" Jerry Seinfeld movie was released 2 years ago.  Holy Time Warp, Batman.  Thanks a lot for the uneasy silence on that one, jeez you would think somebody would have the guts to tell me at least.

Anyway, that's just another sign of age.

So, the weekend was quite the trip, for me anyways.  Friday we got to see an awesome show at Barrymore's.  The Barstool Prophets were amazing, and should never have broken up.  Then on Saturday Robbie and I were off to iPlay for some gaming, which was a lot of fun, getting pounded by 12 year olds.

And then when we got home, the big surprise 80's party was on.  That was really fun, hopefully we can shake loose some pictures from Lockrey or Carol to get up here.  Some people probably wish we wouldn't share those with the world, but hey.

So, I think the 2 week long birthday celebrations are over for me, finally.  I have the best wife in the world, hands down.  You rock baby.
