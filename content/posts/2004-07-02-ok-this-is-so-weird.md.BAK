Ok, this is so weird I just had to link to it.

Basically it boils down to an inkjet printer that lets you print anything you want [on your fingernails](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/imaginail-nailjet-pro-017121.php).  This is really going to revolutionize the tacky fingernail industry, isn't it?  As for me, I'm thinking that a much more practical use will really help this thing take off, like I'm heading to a meeting and I can't be bothered to actually carry the minutes, why not just print them onto my fingernails?  Then my hands are free to carry, um, coffee.

It's at least saving paper, right?  Never mind that I would need to use like font size .2 to fit anything on there.  Or I could grow my fingernails out, you know, for legal sized documents.  I could even use my toenails.  (Wait for it)

For the footnotes.
