Here's your thought for today.  
When you are working too much lately, and don't have enough sleep by far, the most appropriate song to listen to at 8:35am on a Saturday when you are again at work is Mr. Tinkertrain by Ozzy Osbourne.  I can't explain it, it's probably delusional madness/dementia, but that song completely made everything ok, at least for now.
