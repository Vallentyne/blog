Some good stuff out there:

Link to a story about the worst child in the world, or at least a contender.  You will read about this guy later at some point in his life, certainly.  [11 year old boy is confined to his own street](http://society.guardian.co.uk/youthjustice/story/0,11982,1368024,00.html?=rss)


<blockquote>Standing under 5ft but already a criminal veteran, with 13 convictions on top of 10 offences when he was under 10 and could not be charged</blockquote>


Wow.

And another [good article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.12/traffic.html?pg=1&topic=traffic&topic_set=) about how roads would be safer if we removed all of the roadsigns, traffic lights, lane markers and curbs.  Apparently those crazy Dutch are experimenting with these sorts of traffic calming measures.  I do mean crazy, the engineer in the article is quoted while observing one of these busy intersections:


<blockquote>To my mind, there is one crucial test of a design such as this," Monderman says. "Here, I will show you."  With that, Monderman tucks his hands behind his back and begins to walk into the square - backward - straight into traffic, without being able to see oncoming vehicles. A stream of motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians ease around him, instinctively yielding to a man with the courage of his convictions.</blockquote>


Man.  That's gotta be weird.  I can sort of see it though, I know I would be driving a lot slower if there was no indication that someone was going to go through an intersection or not.  Pretty neat idea, and they show that accidents and fatalities go way down at these intersections.
