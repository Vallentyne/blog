I hate scotch as a rule, unless you top it up with coke and ice, which makes Wilson queasy, but this ad for Johnnie Walker is spectacular.Â  If I told you it was about 5 minutes long and described the history of the company through time you would never click the link.Â  It's not boring, trust me.Â  It appears to be a single take, with some good timing and swagger on the part of the narrator (Robert Carlyle) who has a wonderful accent, and as [AdFreak says](http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2009/08/a-stroll-through-history-with-johnnie-walker.html), some gratuitous bagpiper abuse.Â  It's the sort of thing that makes you a fan of the company even if you have no previous attachment to them, like me.Â  I couldn't find an embeddable video, but if you go to JohnnieWalker.com and select your country as United Kingdom you can see the link which is called The Man Who Walked Around the World (bottom right).

Love that ad.

Saw the whole thing on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2009/09/04/the-man-who-walked-around-the-world/) first.
