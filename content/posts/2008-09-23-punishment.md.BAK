It's the purest irony that our bodies work the way they do. Â After a period of sloth, abuse and excess, any exercise is rewarded with a couple of days of extremely sore muscles and pain. Â If I had just kept working out and pushing my body towards some diminishing end point of "fitness" before the summer began, I would feel great right now. Â I similarly felt pretty good before I started working out again, although I definitely didn't look all that good. Â Rather pasty, pudgy and perspire-ey actually. Â So, there you go. Â Our bodies punish us whenever we change states. Â Stop exercising, become Jabba the Hut. Â Start exercising, become Whiny McScreamsalot.

Where's my [exercise pill](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25949447/)? Â I'd probably need to eat them from a bowl like cereal at this point....
