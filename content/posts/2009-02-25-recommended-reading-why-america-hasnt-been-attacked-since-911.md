I caught the first of a seven-day [run of articles on terrorism on Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2208971/), I highly recommend you read it too.Â  It's going to start off at the "don't worry" level and scale right up to the "[pants-sh@!$ing terror](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/27924)" level by the end.Â  The article quotes Bruce Schneier, who I have [mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/07/16/terrorism-doesnt-work/) here [before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/11/01/the-war-on-everything/) as being an entirely sensible voice to listen to in this crazy world.

Stay tuned for the rest of the articles, I know I will be.
