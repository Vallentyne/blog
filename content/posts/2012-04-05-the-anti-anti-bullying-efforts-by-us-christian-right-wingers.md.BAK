Call me idealistic, but for some reason I never cease to be amazed at the depths folks will go to.Â  Certain Christian groups in our wonderful southern neighbour are actively lobbying AGAINST anti-bullying laws because they want to include terminology that would make itÂ perfectly ok to bully if the kids were TAUGHT that being gay/different/whatever wasÂ wrong:Â  "...would have exempted bullies who acted out of "a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction."

I'm speechless, can't really believe this crap.Â  So I won't even bother writing my own thoughts on this particular topic, but instead I will use quotes from the following links to write this post:

[Christians Fight for Their Childrenâ€™s God-Given Right to Bully Gay Kids](http://jezebel.com/5899461/christians-fight-for-their-childrens-god+given-right-to-bully-gay-kids?utm_campaign=socialflow_jezebel_twitter&utm_source=jezebel_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow)

[The Bully Backlash: How the Christian Right Is Attacking Efforts to Help Kids](http://www.alternet.org/story/154863/the_bully_backlash%3A_how_the_christian_right_is_attacking_efforts_to_help_kids?page=entire)

"In Michigan, lawmakers attempted to insert a provision into an anti-bullying bill that would have allowed bullying only on the grounds that it was being done based on a "sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction".Â  _Thankfully it was tossed out after a national outcry.Â _

"A number of groups that claim to represent the "Christian viewpoint" have come out in vigorous opposition to anti-bullying initiatives, and their opposition has to do with a fundamental question about exactly what we think bullying is."

"Senate minority leader David Schapira, a sponsor of his Senate Bill 1462, called her a "legislative terrorist". "Cathi Herrod, an unelected lobbyist (from a Christian right-wing group), killed a bill that would protect all Arizona kids purely because of her intolerance of gay kids."

"To be sure, the notion that the anti-bullying initiatives are driven by "the homosexual agenda" â€“ a phrase that conjures the vision of gay hordes aiming to seduce children into lives of abomination â€“ is preposterous. But the sense that anti-bullying initiatives involve teaching children "acceptance" of LGBT peers, to use the word of the Concerned Women of America, is not. If you want the school to tell students to stop harassing kids like Jacob RogersÂ _because they are gay_, you have to let them know, at some point, that the school thinks it's OK to be gay."

Is anyone else really tired and depressed right now?


"I hate to break it to Christian groups, but if your kid's straightness is so flimsy that it depends on his ability to punch the kids who can't throw a spiral pass in gym class, your kid is probably going to start secretly dating an older man named Bruce or Lance once he gets to college. Rejecting anti-bullying laws is akin to codifying repression and shame. And that's a pretty crappy way to live."







Does anyone else feel just tired and shameful for all of humanity, or is that just me?
