Yesterday we saw that [some countries are concerned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/10/30/because-theres-no-room-for-tattoos/) about it's citizens driving around and being "unhealthy" (Actually it seems [we managed to shame them](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/10/30/7250431-ap.html) into calling the whole thing off. Â Power to the people!), it seems that Ontario is about to reach it's filthy invasive laws right into your car. Â Again, that is. Â Not only will you not be able to [suck down sweet sweet nicotine-infused smoke and share with your kids](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080617.LSMOKE17/TPStory/?query=smoking+ban+in+cars), you can't [be doing that while yakking on the phone](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20081027.CELLPHONES27/TPStory/?query=cell+phone+driving). Â Gods, what kind of police state do we live in? Â What's next, banning [playing video games while driving](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/10/06/one-eye-on-the-road-the-other-on-the-pixels/)? Â Oh wait, that's already covered by the law. Â Will it never end? Â The oppression is more than I can take, it's like someone is choking me every waking minute....

Ok. Â Actually this really isn't that bad. Â The smoking thing is something I can completely get behind, there's no reason to kill your kids while you are killing yourself. Â The cell phone thing is also probably a good idea, since fumbling with a phone is not the best idea while screaming up the ramp at 130KM/h onto the Queensway on two wheels, while eating a donut. Â It's not recommended, you get sticky sugary icing all over your phone. Â You really need to be on your game to drive as dangerously as I do. Â That 2G, three lane change (without signaling, natch) is tricky enough without texting about it at the same time. Â There's plenty of time to be texting to your buddies while you wait for the ambulance and the jaws of life, because as we all know, [ambulance response times](http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=9babe412-2dd3-4520-867f-7daf2253a622) sure aren't getting any shorter.

So, maybe I over-reacted slightly, perhaps. Â It's going to be just fine. Â Really.
