The Ottawa Citizen has a great photo gallery from the[ Westminster dog show](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Photos+updated+Westminster+Kennel+Club+Show/2566899/story.html), which of course is a humongous deal for a teeny tiny fraction of dog owners, and for the rest of us just provides sheer amusement.

I subscribe to the "dogs are incredible, loyal, often hilarious companions, but they are not my life" group, like most folks I think, so the shots of these pampered pooches casting long-suffering looks balefully into the camera are pretty funny.

The caped Corgi shown here in particular seems to be saying "Oh, keep laughing.Â  I will keell you slowly and taste your hot blood on my tongue... aaas soon as I am done perching here like an eediot.Â  What is this?Â  A bird house?Â  What the hell are these things I'm standing on?Â  Corgi stilts?Â  Why am I wearing a purple cape?Â  Bah, I shall keel you all for this.Â  Tremble before me....Tremble!"

Almost every picture there is caption-worthy, I had a hard time deciding which one to make fun of....Â  This guy's super-intense gaze spoke to me.
