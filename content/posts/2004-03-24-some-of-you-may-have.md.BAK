Some of you may have already received the below in an email from me earlier today.  For those of you just joining in, here is the latest on Quinn.  For those of you who have seen this, there's more at the bottom.

Well, as I sit on the couch today folding laundry (enjoying a chore that allows me to sit), I can hear Quinn tittering away upstairs through the monitor.  Cael is sleeping on the floor, and Jordy is outside in the park playing with a friend.  Then, I hear a sound resembling that of little hands fiddling with a door knob.  Yes, you guessed it.  It seems that Quinn has developed cat-like maneuvers, and mastered the art of stealthery (a new word I made up in honour of this occasion).

Somehow, in a skilled and silent manner, unbeknownst to me, he managed to slip undetected from his playpen.  I learn of this as I go to the kitchen to put away my neatly folded washcloths, when all of a sudden his door swings open and he triumphantly shouts, **"MAMA!!!" **looking at me victoriously through the landing mirror.  There I stood, mouth gaping open, and I pose this question to him, "How did you get out of your playpen?!?!??" to which he answers me with a slammed door.

Sigh.

Operation big bed has failed and he can climb from his crib.  What the _HELL_ do we do now!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

As I go up and get the little rascal from his new found glory of running free in his room, I decide to call to Jordynn in from the park, from his upstairs window.  I shout from the window, "Jordy!  Time to come in honey."  She turns and starts heading towards the house when she shouts up to me, "Mom, can you open the front door for me?"  I ask, "Why?" To this she has the audacity to say, "So I can just walk in."

Like, honestly!

Could I have been so accommodating all her life that it is in fact my own fault that she has the gaul to ask me such an outrageous question?  Or, could she just be trying it on for size.  Either way, she opened the door herself.

That's today in a nutshell.  More later I'm sure.
