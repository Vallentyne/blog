Having recently spent some time driving for more than I am used to, I can (almost) symapthize with the following two dunderheads.

A trucker decided that driving was [way too boring](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/10/03/6968671-ap.html), and he decided to pull out his laptop, put it on the dashboard, and cue up an episode of Battlestar Galactica while driving. Â The cop who pulled him over saw that the episode was still playing on the dash. Â His defense? Â He was just listening to the audio while consulting Google Maps, which is clearly an operation that anyone could do while driving.

Then, even better, we have the bus driver who [was caught](http://kgmb9.com/main/content/view/10008/40/) (on video no less) playing videogames while driving his bus around town and on the highway. Â This guy is the dumbest of the dumb since he was playing in full view of his passengers, and so will no doubt be fired faster than you can say game over. Â Hell of a way to waste an 18-year career with a spotless record.... Â Hope he beat the level though.

Â 

On my recent roadtrip, I handed the iPhone to an able passenger to do any Googling or map location finding. Â Methinks the I-81 is not exactly the place for a quick game of anything....
