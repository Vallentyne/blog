The brilliant [Guy on a Buffalo series](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2011/10/01/guy-on-a-buffalo/) reaches the thrilling conclusion in a two-part finale.

Incidentally, the guys behind this ridiculous, awesome and touching web series (Seriously, it has touched me, but not in an inappropriate way, more like the way your Spanish wrestling coach touches you.Â  Is that inappropriate too? Oh.) are a Texas-based bluegrass band called [The Possum Posse](http://www.thepossumposse.com/).Â  Bluegrass isn't always my thing, but from their website this sounds a lot like a band I could get behind.Â  I highly suggest you head over and check out their Kickstarter project to get their first album made.Â  Nice work fellas.Â  If anyone is looking for a gift idea for little old me, I can really see myself wearing one of those Guy on a Buffalo t-shirts.Â  Just sayin'.
