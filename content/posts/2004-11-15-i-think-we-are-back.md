I think we are back from the limbo we were in there for a day.

I did the Suse upgrade at home from RedHat which, despite Robbie's dire predictions, went just fine. It took me a while to figure it all out, but now we are golden, I think.

I looked back to see when I started the RedHat install at home, and in an eerie sort of synchronicity  [I found the post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2003/09/yep-thought-so.htm). I wrote it the day after Quinn's toe surgery, and here we are with just 4 days to go before his hernia surgery. Weird. I seem to be compelled to tinker with arcane operating systems I know nothing about just before Quinn has surgery.

Anyway, maybe that's a Freudian thing of some sort.  I will leave it alone, in case it means something.

I will keep you posted on how things go.
