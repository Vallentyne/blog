Finally found [some confirmation](http://www.aintitcool.com/node/33704) that there may in fact be a second season of Flight of the Conchords, which is only our favourite show ever.Â  Apparently the lads have some serious writing to do since they apparently exhausted almost all of their material on the first season.Â 

Here's hoping the lads can come up with some gems, I don't doubt there will be goodness.Â  Stay tuned.
