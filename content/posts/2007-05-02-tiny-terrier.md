Here's a sad story about a pretty gutsy dog in New Zealand.Â  Apparently a Jack Russell terrier was playing with some children when two pit bulls tried to attack them.Â  The terrier leapt to the kids defence, but wasn't a match for the pit bulls, unfortunately.

It's sad, but it pretty much sums up the best and worst of what people can do to animals.Â  We can make them our best ally and friend, loyal to the very end.Â  Or we can make them into criminals, enemies, shunned and despised by everyone.Â  I guess that goes for people, too.
