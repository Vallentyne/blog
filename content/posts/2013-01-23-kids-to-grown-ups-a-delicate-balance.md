Son or Daughter... does not matter. I think my views on parenting are spot on with hers - minus the panic (so far... meditation goes a long way!). Well put IMHO, and if there was one thing I could add...

Appreciate everyone's individuality. Grant your kids time to process information. Body language may indicate a dislike for your concerns, but when your point has been made respectfully...say nothing and wait. You may be surprised at how they come around. Some will see your concern/wisdom immediately... some will need to process... some will need to dole out attitude first. Time is a gift. Let them have it.
