Well, another year and another VCP under our belt, we are now tireder (still) and older, but given that it was such a good time all is forgiven.Â  There was fewer folks than we thought, but given the blustery and snowy road conditions, I guess we got a great turnout.

There are pictures (lots of pictures) yet to be sorted through. We look for the most embarrassing, least flattering, compromising pictures to be placed on the Internet for safe keeping so they don't fall into the wrong hands.Â  We have to be careful and respectful of our guest's privacy of course.

Some special shout outs:



	  * everyone who brought us a bottle of wine.Â  Thanks so much, Nikki may never need to buy another bottle again.
	  * the guitar lads.Â  Rod and Shaun provided some excellent tunes tirelessly for the living room crew.
	  * PJ for bongoing along gamely, bringing a certain level of professionalism to some rather rambling tipsy guitar songs.
	  * Andre who actually made it to the party through the snow, flying some 3000km or so Google tells me.Â  Good to see the whole Dupuis clan there.
	  * Nikki's fine bar tricks, showing her drop shot prowess over and over.Â  That was the result of some careful experimentation and breaking more than a few glasses, but it paid off.Â  Tracksuits and jÃ¤gerbÃ¶mbers (I think there should be some [rock dots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_umlaut) in there somewhere, I am probably wrong) all round.
	  * Wilson for bringing and sharing said JÃ¤germeister, to the detriment of everyone's sobriety.Â  I think we owe you a bottle, buddy.
	  * Everyone who brought food for the Kanata Food Cupboard.
	  * Everyone who contributed to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and signed our wall.
	  * Everyone who brought food, we ate it all and it was delicious.

I know I have forgotten lots of fine folks, please correct me on any unintentional slights.
