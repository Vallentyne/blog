The fact that I spent ANY time reading a political blog this morning came as a huge shock to myself, let alone any of you.Â  I have RELIGIOUSLY avoided politics for my entire life (now there's a statement, eh?), but after I saw [24 Percent Majority](http://24percentmajority.blogspot.ca) plugged on Boing Boing [last week](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/OQwc7CCGZB0/best-of-canadian-conservative.html) I thought I would check it out, and I liked what I saw.Â  Basically the whole site is critical of the Harper government, but it's an enjoyable, rambling read.Â  If you read nothing else, be sure to check out the [wrap-up of the craziest crap the government has done this year](http://24percentmajority.blogspot.ca/2013/01/2012-best-of-week-87-dec-25-jan-1.html).Â  It's almost enough to make me become a real grownup and pay attention to stuff like this.Â  Almost.Â  :-)

Still, nice work over there, I like it.Â  Definitely a lot of research and linking going into those posts, and a good engaging tone.Â  You must be doing something right if you kept me reading to the end, and I even clicked on a few things to read more!Â  My god.Â  This fit of mature, civic responsibility will certainly pass soon.Â  Or is this what my 40's will be?Â  A gradual awakening to theÂ world at my doorstep, an ever increasing involvement in my civic duty as a voter and a participant in democracy?

Ha, probably not, and I'm sure this blog will soon revert to whatever stupidity I'm looking at on the Internets real soon now, never fear.
