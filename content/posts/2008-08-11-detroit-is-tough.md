How tough?  Thought you would never ask....

Even their mayor has [violated his parole](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2008/08/11/6414276-ap.html) more than once.  That's how tough.

It's almost comedic that this guy was the most charismatic, successful politician in the whole city, (he did win after all) and he currently has multiple (!) legal cases on the go.

Not that we can [throw too many stones](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/02/20/mayor-trial.html) here in Ottawa however....

What is it about mayors these days?
