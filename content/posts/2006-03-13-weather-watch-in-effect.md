I have [mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/05/nice_weather_we.html) the strange things that scientists do before, like publishing the space weather report.  Well, I take it all back, because I guess the pointdexters have actually found something useful this time:  it will be "difficult" to make a cell phone call in 2011 or so.  So try to get your calling done before then, ok?  Yep, apparently Old Yeller up there, Sol, or whatever you want to call the sun, is apparently brewing up a doozy of a radiation bath for us Earth folks.  Hard to say what that will mean to you and I, but I would count on wearing SPF 900 and those inexplicably small, dumb, tanning bed nose-pinch sunglasses to work that year, and maybe the next.  Also, for anyone who hasn't procreated yet, I would invest in some Fruit-of-the-Smelters Leadlined boxers (tm), very important to keep the fuzzy buddies unbaked.

Here's the weather warning from those rocket scientists at, uh, NASA:  [Solar Storm Warning](http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/10mar_stormwarning.htm?list862664)
