Nikki and I had a nice weekend, it's one of our quarterly parental getaways.  We decided a while ago that they were absolutely required for our own sanity since we get little time to ourselves alone.  Usually we don't even go very far, the only requirement is to get out of the house without children for an extended period of time.  This time we just went and stayed right downtown at the [Minto Suites](http://www.mintosuitehotel.com/).  It's very nice and the rates are reasonable, especially once you tell them you are on a weekend pass from the insane asylum.  Anyway, it was extremely relaxing, we ate and drank lots of excellent food and are generally recharged and refreshed.  One special note was that we ate at [Hy's Steakhouse](http://www.hyssteakhouse.com) and had a superb experience.  It's not for everyday dining, but man if you want to treat yourself, that's one especially good way to do it.  The service is second to none.

So there you go, that's an update for you.

*Update:Â  Note that we didn't actually drink any food....Â  That's just too hard.
