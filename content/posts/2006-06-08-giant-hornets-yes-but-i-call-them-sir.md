If this doesn't give you a huge case of the willies, then I say you are dead inside.  The [Asian Giant Hornet](http://www.vespa-crabro.de/manda.htm) is big big big, scary big.  Movie big.  Man.  From the link:


<blockquote>"this gigantic, voracious predator has a quarter-inch stinger (6.35mm)! People are usually not the Japanese giant hornet's prey, but those who have felt its sting describe the pain as excruciating and very painful"</blockquote>


Ya think?  Jayyysus.  Crap on a stick.  I don't like it, nossir.  Brrrrhoooahh.
