Well the quest for fitness continues.Â  We were inspired by a few folks Nikki to start doing the [P90X](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/p90x.do?code=P90XDOTCOM) workout.Â  There's lots of stuff on the web about it, but the safest thing I can say about it is that it's really tough.Â  It's 90 days long, 6 days a week of crazy hard workouts.Â  Every morning takes at least an hour, sometimes 1.5 hours.Â  The unexpectedly nice thing about the DVD-driven workouts is you can't really take it that easy when you know the next exercise is coming along in 1 minute or so.Â  If the same workouts were described in a book they probably wouldn't be nearly as effective.Â  We are definitely enjoying it, but have a looong way to go yet.

On the decidedly lighter side of the exercise spectrum, Wired has a [couple](http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/03/diary-one-week.html) of [articles](http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/03/me-and-wii-fit.html) about the new exercise game coming out, Wii Fit.Â  It's basically a platform you stand on and perform various exercises in response to the game.Â  It keeps track of your weight and personal bests, and you workout to earn new games to exercise to.Â  I guess there's a market for this somewhere but it definitely sounds, er, lightweight.Â  Maybe there's a sense of accomplishment from unlocking new areas with hard work, just like in a regular video game, but the actual physical conditioning doesn't sound very intense.Â  Now if they had some Wii motion sensing dumbells with selectable weights, you may have the beginnings of something then.Â  The game could encourage you to push yourself much like a personal trainer could, but in the warm embrace of your living room.

I don't see this replacing P90X anytime soon.Â  Besides, that Tony Horton guy is just way too corny and funny.Â  He is still cracking us up, but maybe that's just sleep deprivation and fatigue.
