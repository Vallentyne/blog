Well it's that day of the year when it means a little extra to have my last name.Â  It's cheesy, and goofy, sure.Â  Still I would rather be called Vallentyne than, say Halloween.Â  So there you go.

So, Happy Vallentyne's day to Nikki, she's the reason I don't just drink beer alone on February 14th anymore, it's a lot more fun to do that with someone.Â  (I'm kidding, I always drank vodka)

I love you baby.

And yes, there will be much more heartfeltÂ  Valentine's wishes later in person, what did you think I was going to get all mushy on the blog?
