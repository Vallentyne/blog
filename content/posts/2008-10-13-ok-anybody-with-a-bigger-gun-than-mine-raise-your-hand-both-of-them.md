Sometimes you can see the future, and you wonder why nobody else can. Â Or maybe lots of other people can in fact see the future, but don't say anything about it. Â In this case, it's kind of scary, but mostly dumb.

A certain Texan school district has "wisely" decided that they will start the new term allowing teachers to [carry concealed firearms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7564654.stm) in the classroom. Â The reasoning is that teachers are the best line of defence for students in case there are any gun attacks on campus. Â The money quote here is this one from the disctrict superintendent:


<blockquote>"When the federal government started making schools gun-free zones, that's when all of these shootings started..."</blockquote>


Um, ya. Â If anybody here is in touch with reality, raise your hand? Â More [guns in the classroom](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/05/22/rampant-gun-tards/) is definitely the answer to this rash of shootings in schools. Â In fact, it's basically an arms race between the teachers and students, and by gum if the teachers don't win it, what will you have? Â Anarchy I say! Â Just in time for the new school year:Â Staedtler Automatic Assault Rifles, now in three cool colours! Â 

What the living heck is going on in Texas? Â I will make a small prediction here, if I may (and it's my blog, so I may): Â In the next 10 years, there will be a(n even more) complete dissolution of trust between teachers and the students, to the point where there will not be teachers actually in the classrooms with the students, but will instead be teaching via a monitor, screen, or maybe just behind a scratched, scarred bulletproof glass, dotted with spitballs. Â Or maybe we will develop "teaching suits" for the teachers to wear, like armoured Robocops stomping around between the desks, gunfire ricocheting off their armored heads every time they turn their back. Â "Timmy, I know the sound of a Glock when I hear it, I know that was you. Â If you shoot me in the head one more time, I'm going to, um, ask you to stop shooting me again."

Ok, look you can't teach when kids bring guns to class, that's for sure. Â The problem isn't going to be solved by the teachers packing heat, either. Â You have to address this kind of [rampant pro-gun mentality](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/06/10/openly-displaying-your-contempt-for-civilization/) over time, public relations campaigns, laws, and for pete's sake make it harder to buy a gun than just getting it [tossed into your shopping bag](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/05/23/gun-tards-part-2/) as a bonus. Â You have to find a way to remove guns from the everyday urban landscape before this issue will fix itself.

Am I crazy here?

Thanks to [Wilson](http://robertwilsonphoto.com/) for setting me off on this one.
