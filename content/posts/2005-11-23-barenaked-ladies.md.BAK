Nikki and were lucky enough to go the Barenaked Ladies show last night at the NAC.   I have been a casual fan up to now, but seeing the show live made us both agree that we need to buy more of their music.   That was my first time at one of their shows and it was well worth the (somewhat expensive) ticket price.  Lots of good music and humour.

In light of [recent CD copy protection fiascos](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/14/sony_anticustomer_te.html), I must say that the band's decision to offer unrestricted MP3s of each show online is very very smart.  They have probably been doing this for a while and I'm just late to the party.  They are also [releasing a USB memory stick with a whole bunch of unprotected content](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/16/barenaked_ladies_rel.html), which is also brilliant.  You get to listen to the music and reuse the memory stick.  Anyway, it's just nice to see a band that understands that fans probably aren't going to steal anything and so they shouldn't be treated like criminals.

Incidentally, and against all odds, searching for "Barenaked Ladies" on Google is remarkably safe, but it seems to me that it shouldn't be.  I mean, really.  It should be one of those "oh man what am I going to get back, I shouldn't be looking for this at work" cringe-click moments.  Weird.
