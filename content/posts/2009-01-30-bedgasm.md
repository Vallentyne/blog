This word probably needs no explanation, but I still like it.Â  Especially today, when I am a little sleep deprived...

[Bedgasm](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bedgasm&defid=2451094):


<blockquote>A feeling of complete and utter euphoria which peaks when climbing into bed at the end of an 18-hour workday, a long road trip or hours of extremely strenuous physical activity. Under perfect conditions, the physical release has been likened to that of an intense sexual experience.

_It was a three hour drive in the middle of the night, I could barely stay awake. When I got home, I climbed under the covers and had a ten-minute bedgasm._</blockquote>
