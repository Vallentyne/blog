Well, things are coming to an end for my contract here.  It's been a good run certainly, and lots of fun.  So, this means that I am again seeking gainful employment.  

A side effect of this activity is that I may be actually, well, at home starting in September.  With the kids.  All day.  Day after day.  Like Nikki does every day, of course.

Now, where did I put those want ads?
