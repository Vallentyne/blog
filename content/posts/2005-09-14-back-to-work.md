Well, unfortunately for Nikki, I'm back to work this week.  

I'm not sure if I was any real help to her while I was home anyway, but she's on her own again.  The break was short-lived, and to be honest I was sort of bummed to have to go back.  It was a nice leisurely pace this time, and for one reason or another I wasn't stressed about anything.  The weather was also beautiful, which helped.  All in all a nice holiday.

The new gig is very good, and very busy.  There's literally three rooms full of servers I need to get a handle on, and very soon.  The folks here are patient with me so far, thank goodness.

Anyway, that's all I have for the job update.  Thanks to those of you who asked about my employment status.
