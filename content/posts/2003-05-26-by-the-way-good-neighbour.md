By the way, good neighbour Jim has been on one of his periods of craziness, er, adventure races since Saturday.  It's a 7 day race in Scotland, mountain biking, hiking, kayaking, and some swimming.  The web coverage isn't as good as the last race, different company, but there are race updates on [www.sleepmonsters.com](http://www.sleepmonsters.com).  Check out the Independent Networks Adrenalin Rush Race Reports for news, and the Leader board for rankings.  Jim's team is called CAN-IT-UK, they are in 7th place right now, pretty darn excellent considering they are only 2 hours out of first place.

Anyway, if there are any changes to report, I will try to post them here, but check out the results for yourself.

later,
Court
