Ok, so birthday thing aside, here's the best idea of the last 40 years?  50 years?

It's [a flashlight that takes any kind of battery](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2004-09-15-flashlight-advance_x.htm).

It will take AA, C, and D batteries.  That's so obviously smart it makes me sick for not thinking of it first.

Curse my aging brain.
