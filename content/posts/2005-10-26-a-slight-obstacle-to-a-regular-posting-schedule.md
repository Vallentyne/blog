Well, it seems that my "wasting time at work posting to the blog" days are over for the next while.  It seems that the good firewall folks at my current gig have grown wise to my dirty little habit and have, well, blocked all access to the Vallentyne.com infrastructure.  That's a slight pain for any posting, but it's a real problem for mail access.

All of this to say, today was one of the most productive days I have had at work in some time.  My attention span grew back, against all odds.

But, the discovery of [this blog](http://www.damninteresting.com) is once again eating away at my time.  Just try to stop reading through the archive, I dare you.  This damn site (sigh) is a definite cut above the regular fare on the web.  The latest [post](http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=132) in particular is incredibly interesting and funny.  I wish I could write stuff like that.

Anyway, that's it for tonight, don't expect much here until at least tomorrow night, cause the problem is access.... mine, not yours.
