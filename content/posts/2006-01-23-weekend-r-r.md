Good Monday Afternoon folks.

Nik and I had an extremely relaxing weekend goofing off while Paul and Darlene (bless them) watched the kids.  So of course today I am energized, refreshed, bouncy, perky, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, etc.  Yeah, right.  Nope, I'm not actually.  Looking forward to more sleep real soon now.

Actually, we did very little that required any effort, even staying up late drinking beer didn't win out over sleeping this time.  We ate lots, though.  That could be the reason I'm a little sluggish.  Can't say enough as we always do about the [Japanese Village](http://www.japanesevillage.net/), I have never had a bad meal there.  It's incredible the quality of the food, almost as incredible as the shocking state of the facilities.  Those guys need a new carpet, among other things.  If I didn't know better, I probably wouldn't eat there.  However, just trust me on this one, the food makes up for it immensely.  First rate.

Beyond the eating and the sleeping, there's not much I care to share here, except that I thoroughly enjoyed spending some time with my wife, whom I love very much.  Smoochies to her, apologies to everyone else for the sugar overdose.
