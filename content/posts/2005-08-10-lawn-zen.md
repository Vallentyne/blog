As Nikki will probably tell you, especially if you ask, I am a little, slightly, just ever so obsessed with the condition of my lawn.  The problem is that I am very very bad at it.  I suck.  I would love to have a rich full lawn, but I'm challenged.  Anyway, I found [this essay](http://www.richsoil.com/lawn/index.jsp) on the web and thought I would share it.  It's called Organic Lawn Care for the Cheap and Lazy, and it spoke to me loudly in my soul.  Mostly because I am both cheap and lazy, separately, but sometimes both at the same time.

Anyway, it's very good advice and I thought I would share it with some of you other cheap and lazy folks.  I plan to really think hard about starting to attempt to implement a plan to start to do some of the things he suggests.  Later.  And if it doesn't cost too much.
