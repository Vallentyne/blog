Nikki and I hosted our first 70's themed Newlywed Game on Friday evening.  It was a great success and lots of fun.  I must say that the only thing more surprising than the costumes were some of the revelations that we came to that evening.  For instance:

- Bob showed us that Home Depot is an excellent source of menswear accessories, as well as some seriously insightful arguments on the benefits of controlling the laundry at home.
- Wilson didn't completely fulfill predictions by taking home a mighty bruise from one or both of Lockrey's fists.
- Julie and Rob's strategy of default answers failed miserably, but somehow they managed to take home the goodies anyway.  Maybe the lesson to take away is to just have a strategy, even if it's a terrible one.
- Nikki rocked the party with the smokin-est hair this side of Funkytown.



Honourable mentions:  MC's absolutely-nailed-it outfit that brought everyone back to grade school, Lockrey's um... uniboob, and Lisa's outfit that clearly started life as a circus tent.

And finally the best part, we have pictures, oh yes, they are coming.  Public humiliation for all....
