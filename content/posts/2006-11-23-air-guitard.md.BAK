I have no idea why people are still making news about air guitar, but since it's my duty to report it, here we go.

Apparently the [last air guitar innovation I mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/12/07/im-just-doing-my-rock-and-roll-duty/) just isn't enough for air guitar maniacs.  Nope, in fact someone else has developed an entirely new dorky way to pretend to play guitar.Â  It's a shirt with sensors in it that detect your talentless windmilling and convert the pathetic noodly flagellation into hugely rad power chords so you can totally shred to your hearts content.Â  Interestingly, the technology only works if they imbed it into a shirt that has "I'm a huge dork" printed on the front.

Here you go, the [press release](http://www.csiro.au/csiro/content/standard/ps2gl,,.html) about the most rockingest "textile-based interface" evar.Â  A clip:

Yep, that's Dr Richard "The Hammer" Helmer dropping it down hard at the textile lab.
