And on a lighter note, I give you [ARNOCORPS](http://www.arnocorps.com/), the Arnold Swarzenegger tribute band.

<blockquote>Song lyrics are comprised of scripts from the Calilfornia governor's movies. The lead singer sings in a schwarzenegg_euro_ accent.</blockquote>


I can't listen at work due to firewall restrictions, but I'm sure that the available downloads are bound to be hilarious.
