Won't take credit for someone else's fine work, but couldn't resist snapping this one at lunch on Friday.Â  If you frequent a certain Ottawa pizza joint, you may have seen this one yourself.

There's just no other way to interpret these instructions, written on some sort of bacon dispensing machine.Â  Thank heaven for bacon dispensing machines.

It _is_ rather strange to use a cameraphone in a bathroom, and I felt strange doing it, for sure.

Enjoy.
