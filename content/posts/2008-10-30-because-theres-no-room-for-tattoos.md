A [new law in Vietnam](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/10/28/7228766-ap.html) prohibits anyone with a chest measurement smaller than 28 inches from riding a motorcycle. Â Also if you are too short, or too thin you had better find another ride, son.

This new push is a result of the government there trying to make sure that all of their drivers are in good health.

So, if you are fat, you are good to go on a bike. Â Nothing says healthy like a really overweight person on a motorcycle. Â Yep, it was those short thin people that were making the country look bad. Â Better get them off the streets.

Fortunately, I'm not the only one who thinks this is dumb:


<blockquote>Vietnamese bloggers have been poking fun at the plan, envisioning traffic police with tape measures eagerly pulling over female drivers to measure their chests.

"From now on, padded bras will be best-sellers," said Bo Cu Hung, a popular Ho Chi Minh City blogger.</blockquote>


Even better, there really seems to be no actual problem here:


<blockquote>The average Vietnamese man is 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 121 pounds. The average Vietnamese woman is 5 feet, 1 inch tall and weighs 103 pounds.

Statistics on average chest size were unavailable.</blockquote>


Gold.
