Oh man,




I need [this thing](http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/ROODEF.htm) so bad, it's ridiculous.




It's an automated sentry robot that can detect motion, verbally issue a challenge and then open fire on the intruder.  Shooting a whole magazine of nerf disks at the intruder, I might add.  It comes with a remote control so you can enter your domain without injury.




It "makes Robocop noises" when it starts, it's all good.




That web site has some incredible toys, also check out this [rubber band gatling gun](http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/GATGUN_TOYS.htm) that can fire off 144 rubber band rounds in just 12 seconds.  Make sure you hit what you were after though, cause reloading it can take 30 minutes.
