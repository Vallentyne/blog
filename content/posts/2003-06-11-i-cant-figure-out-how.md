I can't figure out how some people don't automatically learn respect for others, while for most of us it's built right in, no question of it at all.  What's the secret here?  Do we really need to tell someone, "don't hit"?  It's apparent to me that this statement is true, but for the life of me I can't tell you why.  Somebody smacks you one, not only do you stay there, but then help deny and cover it up, basically asking for another punch since that one was ok.  This applies to adults and children by the way.

Amazing.  Sad.

Pretty heavy stuff here.
