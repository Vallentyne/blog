Ok, I'm a Dylan fan, to be sure.  I have [mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2003/05/so_i_finished_r.html) [it](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2003/11/keen_readers_of.html) [a](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2003/12/a_nice_little_p.html) [few](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/09/on_the_music_si.html) [times](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/dylan_biography.html) [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/10/the_doors_dont.html) [before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/im_rather_tired.html).

However, I'm not terribly in touch with Bob's professional life it would seem because I saw [this today](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1759452,00.html?gusrc=rss) and was completely surprised by it.  Apparently Bob is doing a radio show now, or will be soon.  It's called "Theme Time Radio Hour" and he does everything a regular DJ would do, I suppose.  He intros the songs himself and shares some anecdotes, but mostly it's about the music, which of course is not his own.  In fact most of the music is quite old in the first installment, so it will be neat to hear what he picks.  The playlist is shown in the Observer article.  
Wow.  I can't wait to hear this, although it's on XM radio I'm confident that the Internet will bridge that chasm for me without much delay.

What a cool and neat idea.  That old guy really surprises the hell out of me sometimes.
