As far as viral video goes, this one is excellent.Â  It's funny and touching at times, but mostly it's an excellent message about melanoma that people need to hear and understand, especially kids.Â  It's long past the time where you could say "maybe you know someone", instead most of us can probably list several loved ones who have been affected somehow.
