We all know you sing in the shower, and in the car when you are alone.  It's ok, don't worry.  As long as you sing alone there's no trouble.  The problem starts when you think you want to sing for other people.....  That's my problem anyway.  It seems that if I have a beer or two I think it's a great idea to pick up a guitar and start singing and playing.  The problem has always been that I'm not good at it.  I have breezily discounted that as a result of being tone deaf.  I was safe thinking, I'm bad at singing but I have a reason, like a doctor's note.  Anyway, I saw this little online test for tone-deafness and it just ruined my whole day.

It's not short (maybe 6min), but it's pretty cool.  I finished the test with 70% which means I'm actually not tone deaf at all, really.  It's quite hard actually, it will have you second guessing yourself.  I think you would do well to use headphones while taking it (I did not).

I saw this first on [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/).
