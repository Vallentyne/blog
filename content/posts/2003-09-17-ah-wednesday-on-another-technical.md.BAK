Ah.  Wednesday.

On another technical note I have given Darcy free rein on the Vallentyne.com server farm to put some Cornstock-related pictures and content.  I'm sure I will regret that really soon now.

Most of the pictures from this year's Cornstock come from Vallentyne.com, near as I can figure.  Ah well, glad to help.

So, still no posts from anybody here besides me.  I hope I won't have to resort to any desparate plea to come back now that the darn blog is working again.  That would be pathetic.

I'm not desperate or anything.  Or bored.  Really.
