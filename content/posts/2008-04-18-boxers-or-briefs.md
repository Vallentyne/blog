Ah, the eternal question (well at least for men).Â  Indeed there are even several kinds of boxers, so this field is rife with controversy and [personal preference](http://www.slate.com/id/2143313/nav/tap1/).Â  I give you the [boxer (or boxer shorts)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_shorts), the [boxer brief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_briefs), and the [brief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briefs).Â  They all have their pluses and minuses to be sure.Â  What is the one true kind of underwear?Â  I cannot say, but I can only add this: Before I really adopted the boxer brief, I was painfully single.Â  With the boxer brief in my life, I was soon happily married.Â  You do the math.

Which brings me to the topic of the post.Â  Like all men, Cael had to find his own way in the underwear department.Â  For some reason he ended up with several pairs of briefs in the last while.Â  He had more pairs of boxer briefs (tastefully adorned with Spider Man and Batman of course) than anything, but I guess sometimes he wore the briefs.Â  Anyway, he finally arrived at his own conclusion the other day.Â  He was visibly uncomfortable at the table, shifting and wincing.Â  Finally he said:

"This tight underwear hurts my knuckles."

Indeed they do, son.Â  And so he took another small step into manhood with the decision to wear underwear that does not hurt his, ahem, knuckles.
