This morning I got to to work, grabbed a coffee, and sat down to read some news on the web before I started to work.Â  I'm pretty lucky I guess, because a team of Royal Engineers from the British Army spent their morning [trying to defuse a World War 2 bomb discovered in London](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2008/06/06/5792396-ap.html).

Imagine that for a moment.Â  Not only are you dealing with a bomb, it's a huge bomb (1000Kg), and to top it all off it's probably incredibly unstable since it's been sitting there rusting for 50 years or so.Â  Probably not a lot of fun....

Still, with typical British understatement, the whole thing was tremendously underplayed.


<blockquote>Saunders confirmed that at one point the bomb had started to tick but said engineers dealt with the problem.</blockquote>


Started to tick? WTF?


<blockquote>He said he could not recall when the ticking was noticed.</blockquote>


Really?Â  Couldn't recall eh?Â  I would imagine it was probably around the time that the whole team of engineers simultaneously shat their pants.Â  Maybe a little before that.

Honestly.Â  I just love that quote.
