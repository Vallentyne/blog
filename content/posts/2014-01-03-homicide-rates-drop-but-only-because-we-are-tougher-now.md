So this is rather interesting, we are dying a lot less from violent crime. It seems that while there are actually more violent crimes, the ones that do happen are a lot less deadly since we more or less survive them now. This means that either we have become stupendous badasses, or medicine is more amazing than ever. I will lean towards the latter since in general I don't feel any more badass than before.

Anyway there you are, some food for thought for the new year.Â  Can't decide if it's a cup half full or half empty kind of thing, but fewer deaths is always a good thing.
