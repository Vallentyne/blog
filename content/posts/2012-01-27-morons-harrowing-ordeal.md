A Texan woman got her car stuck in some mud in Idaho, and despite the fact that she was COMPLETELY UNINJURED and perfectly fine, proceeded to spend the next week in the car.Â  She "survived" by eating peanut butter M&Ms.Â  She would probably still be there, except the water in the pond she was stuck near started to rise, so she finally got out and walked (walked!) over to a nearby house to get help.

The only explanation she offered for this absolutely stupefying act of brainlessness was that sheÂ had "always been told not to leave her vehicle if she became stranded".Â  Wow.Â  Just wow.Â  The best part is that this little gal who was just doing what she was told is **61 YEARS OLD**.Â  In 61 years she never came up with anything better than "stay with the car" even if the nearest house is within walking distance for a 61 year old moron.

Cripes.Â  How did she make it to 61 years old?
