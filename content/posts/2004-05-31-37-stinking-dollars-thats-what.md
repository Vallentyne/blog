37 stinking dollars.

That's what garage sales proceeds added up to.  $37.  Twelve of which came from the sale of delicious chocolate chip cookies and lemonade.  Like jeez.  Talk about your retail downturn, that was ridiculous.  I even brought the guitar out to stimulate some interest, but I guess it all seemed a bit too "Deliverance" for people.  I guess the consensus is we were competing with the Glebe and our Kanata stuff seemed a bit shabby in comparison.

crud.  Now I have to keep the stuff piled in the garage for the next sale day.
