Nothing like a nice bowl of cereal in the morning with Mom.  Or at least that's what a 5 year old boy in England was thinking until he poured his cereal and [found a 2 foot snake in the box](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/4512995.stm).

Fortunately it was non-poisonous, but come on people.

That's not a lot of fun.
