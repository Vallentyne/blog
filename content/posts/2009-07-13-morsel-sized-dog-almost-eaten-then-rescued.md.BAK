A _delicious_ chihuahua puppy was [almost eaten](http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/offbeat/090711_Fork_Lodged_in_Dogs_Brain) this past weekend in Kentucky at a family barbecue.Â  The plump, juicy young puppy accidentally got covered in delicious mesquite BBQ sauce, then mistakenly liberally sprinkled with salt and pepper, and coincidentally wrapped in foil (shiny side in) before getting in the way of a flying utensil and fortunately stopping the fork with it's head.Â  Truth be told, it only narrowly averted getting munched in the meat eating frenzy by running away and hiding in the bush for a few days until the coast was clear, and the last of the hot dogs and burgers was consumed.

Then the family took the dog to the vet to get the huge fork removed from his head.Â  Strangely, the dog will be just fine, or it should at least survive until the next barbecue...

Ok, so the family says the fork thing was an accident, maybe I might have taken some dramatic liberties with the facts.

Seriously, glad the dog is ok, but that's weird one.
