Blast and damn.Â  I had a couple of things I wanted to mention on Earth Day and didn't get a chance to do so.Â  Must be the viral invader in my system messing with my synapses.Â  Anyway, first a good article about how the biggest question we all face when thinking about doing something about climate change is "[Why Bother?](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/magazine/20wwln-lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1)".Â  It's a good piece, and makes a fairly strong case that if we each do something, everybody bothers to do one little thing, then we create a sort of social pressure to do more, like a positive feedback loop.Â  Individual effortsÂ hardly matter at all to the environment directly, but maybe our example to others will help start a wave of change that will actually make a difference.Â  His favourite personal act seems to be starting a vegetable garden in your yard.Â  Anyway it's a good read, check it out.

Then we have a feel-good commercial for the Discovery Channel, [I Love the Whole World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BxymuiAxQ).Â  Catchy and fun.

Happy Belated Earth Day folks.
