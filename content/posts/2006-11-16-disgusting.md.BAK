I can hardly believe that this is happening, really.  Only in the U.S. would a guy who managed to get away with killing his wife and another guy be able to write a book about it under the thin guise "If I did it, Here's how it happened".  Unbelievable.  Hypothetical confessions get you huge book deals, but only if the whole world thinks you are actually guilty.

**Update.

It seems that good taste has prevailed somewhat and the whole thing has [been canceled](http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/11/21/oj.cancel.ap/index.html).Â  A close call.
