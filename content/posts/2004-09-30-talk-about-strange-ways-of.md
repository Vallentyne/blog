Talk about strange ways of kicking the bucket at home, if you don't have a wild baby living in your furnace, you should be careful of cute cuddly rodents.  Hamsters.  You don't believe me?  This guy [died after being bitten by his hamster](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/30/killer_hamster/).  They can be quite vicious, believe me.  All they do is exercise in that wheel all day long, honing their skills, patiently waiting, waiting.
Creepy.
