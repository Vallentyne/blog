First, it appears that Bruce [came out in favour of Barack Obama](http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2008/04/16/5306546-ap.html) on his [website](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/news/index.html).Â  Nice, I personally think he's the best choice for president myself.Â  Not Obama, Bruce of course.Â  Wouldn't he just be totally cool as President?

Then I see that maybe his credibility is not quite what it used to be, since here he is selling us on Microsoft Vista Service Pack 1....Â  doesn't quite have the same zing.Â  I should mention that I can only assume that this is in fact a video of Bruce Springsteen, I can't actually watch it since I'm at work and I should be working instead of writing this.

***** Update

Oh lordy, now that I have actually seen this video with my own eyes, my weak take on sarcasm above does not cover it.Â  This video is so bad I couldn't watch more than 40 seconds.Â  I can't believe they made this.Â  It makes Microsoft look so uncontrollably bad, so much worse and uncool (if that was possible), just producing this video just sold at least 2 million more Macs.Â  Oh my god.Â  I'm ashamed to say that this stuff pays the bills for me....
