Ahh, the post garage sale glow is upon us.  We now have less stuff than we used to have.  It's a win.

That's pretty much all you hope for anyway, right?  People come by, check out your stuff, if they like it they pay a nominal fee to haul it away.  It's good, and we would have made more money if we would just quit saying; what do you want to pay me for it?  Invariably they would just say less than half of what we should have asked for in the first place.  Oh well.

Now we are just going to haul the rest of the stuff off to the Salvation Army.

Basement reno is still progressing, we had an excellent session on Thursday night with Neighbour Nick and Nikki's Dad.  There is still some basic construction that I am trying to get out of the way before I start on the electrical stuff; one bulkhead I built on the weekend that appears to be just slightly too long, d'oh.  The pile of sawdust grows ever bigger...  If things keep going the way they have been, I could imagine being ready for drywall sometime near the Thanksgiving long weekend.  Here's hoping, anyway.  That's the big one, and then from there it's taping and sanding and a coat (or two) of paint.  And then I turn my attention to the flooring.
