Nothing to read here, move along.

I have had very little motivation to write something new here recently, sorry if I disappoint anybody (probably not, you are most likely immune to the blog droughts by now if you are still coming here today).  I have only these few things to share, which I have freely stolen from [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/) and [Table of Malcontents](http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/):

Amazing acrobatics that make me feel old and tired just watching it.  I don't think I believe the title of the video, which definitely sounds a tad make-believe, but the video itself is still compelling.

Then a [cool video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2LUz2WVcek) about a promotion for Jeep with an incredible waterfall display.  It's mesmerizing.

And finally a quick link to a [happy little fun game](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/360724) where you play as an infectious disease, and your job is to evolve in the right way to infect and ultimately kill all of the nasty humans on the planet.  What a better way to lift your spirits on a Friday afternoon, than by eliminating those pesky frickin' bipeds?

There you go folks.
