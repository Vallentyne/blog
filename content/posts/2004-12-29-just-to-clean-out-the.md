Just to clean out the "Absolutely Stupid Crap that I may want to post about at some point to further a comedic purpose" folder, here are some things that are mostly related to each other.

We start on the Christmas theme: [The Star Wars Christmas Album](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/26/more_kitschy_star_wa.html), featuring Bon Jovi singing "R2-D2 We Wish You A Merry Christmas".

Which brings me to [a link about absolutely disgusting food](http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/cat_steve_dont_eat_it.php), which is (very) thinly connected to the C3P0 cereal.  This article basically mentions in passing how Urkel-O's compare to C3P0's in terms of promotional tie-ins, which is to say maybe not very well.

..and that brings me very neatly to this link, the stunning conclusion of my web of connections (get it? "web" is used here, it means both a connection and the "World Wide Web"... oh nevermind):  [Meat Scented Air Fresheners](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/23/meatscented_air_fres.html), which are both disgusting and food related.

Ah, thank goodness for the holidays at work, where you could fling a meat scented air freshener and not hit a soul in the office.
