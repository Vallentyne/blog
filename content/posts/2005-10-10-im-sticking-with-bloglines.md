As pretty much [80% of the posts I read](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/08/google-reader-beautiful-needs-work/) concur, I must admit that I can't stand the way the Google reader shuffles the posts for me.  It's a deal breaker, and I'm out for this one until they fix it.  I found the visual feedback that the refresh was actually happening a little lacking, but that could have been just what I'm used to.

I still love the keyboard navigation though.

I have to stick with the [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com), folks.  It's the only site I visit _absolutely _every time I'm on the web.  There's just no substitute.

I honestly can't imagine life without it.
