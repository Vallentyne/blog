This isn't good, people.  

For some reason a bunch of scientists are working for the "other side" and have created a race of practically [indestructible rodents](http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,68962,00.html).  I don't know who turned these guys against us, but boy is this going to be a problem.  Apparently these mice can regrow just about anything you cut off them, and heal most of their organs with little or no scar tissue.  

Oh, yes it's a miracle.  Wonderful.  I'm sure you will be just thrilled about it when they have overthrown and enslaved us all and start doing tests on us and are puzzled when our limbs don't grow back like theirs.

It could happen.
