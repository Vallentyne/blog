First post after the long weekend, my brain isn't working at full speed yet.  I have a lot of stuff to get up here though, so here goes.

Births first off:
First off, congrats to Tammy and Roy on the birth of their little girl Shiann Isabel Josephine.  She was born yesterday, 9lbs 7oz.  Word is mom and baby are doing very well, while Roy is a little rattled.

Then, more congrats to Lincoln and Krista today on the birth of their third son, Palmer.  Krista was not so fortunate, 11lbs 5oz.  Wow.  I'm thinking separate beds will soon appear in their bedroom.

In more mundane news we were at Cornstock this weekend.  Mom came and watched the monkeys, er, the boys for us, many thanks for that.  We had a great time, and even though we missed the main Saturday night, it felt just like Sunday Morning Coming Down when I woke up on Saturday.  Thanks to Darcy and Drew and all the Dicks for putting up with us.

As for the kids, well the big news is of course school starts this week.  Jordy is in grade 4 as I mentioned and we all breathed a large sigh of relief after finding out she likes her teacher.  So far so good.  Nikki is also breathing a quieter sigh of relief.

Cael seems determined to just walk.  Not crawl, not even really do a good job of sitting up alone, nope.  He also is determined to cut teeth two at a time.  He has like 4 teeth through the gum now, but not symmetrical, so he looks like a hillbilly.  No offense to any hillbilly blog readers intended.

Quinn is slowly making some of the right moves towards potty training, which is a good thing.  We will keep you posted on that situation.
