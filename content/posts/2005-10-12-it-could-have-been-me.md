Very [entertaining story](http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051009/NEWS01/510090374/1077) of a dad who was mistaken for someone abducting children, but they happened to be his own.  

He comes out a store and finds that his brats have crawled into the trunk of his car using the pass-through in the back seat, he says get back into your seats and drives away.  This was enough to have the police issue a nation-wide Amber alert with his face all over every news broadcast.  

While I appreciate the observant passersby and the prompt alert they generated, but I could see this happening to many many other parents.  

Anyway, all's well that ends well, fortunately.
