Let me just say that I forgot my power adapter this morning when I left for a whole day of work offsite. Â Nikki has her brand-new work-issued HP EliteBook laptop, I have my year-old used MacBook Pro. Â Her battery was dead before lunch, and mine is still going (albeit down to the dregs now) at 4pm. Â I didn't have it on all day, and it wasn't all that graphic intensive, but I was using lots of WiFi all day. Â I only just turned down the brightness so I could get this blog post out.

That is some nice battery life....
