Well today I bring good news and bad news.

The bad news is if you own a fancy bike lock, you're probably screwed.  The news on the web today is those Kryptonite locks that cost a fortune are easily defeated by a .29c Bic pen in about 2 seconds.

Here's the [link on Wired.com

And now for the good news.  If you happen to own a very expensive bike, lock it up with your expensive lock and return to find that your bike has been stolen with a very inexpensive pen, you may be very glad that you can now buy [a prescription-stength over the counter heart defibrillator](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6020916/).  Yessiree, that shock machine thingy they use to restart your heart in hospitals is now available to anyone with $2000 in their pocket.  It's really a must-have item.  I mean the humour value alone makes the price seem worthwhile.  It delivers enough current to light a 150 watt bulb for one second, or in other words enough to knock down your brother when you jump him when he's soaking wet from the shower and leaving him twitching on the bath mat.

It's a great world we live in.
