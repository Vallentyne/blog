I don't generally post personal details about Nikki and I, but I'm going to break that rule today.Â 

I'm about to tell you exactly how a huge nerd like me wooed her and just how we keep things fresh, if you know what I mean.Â  That's right, we're talking the same language now....Â  office products.Â  Nikki is an absolute fiend for fancy office products.Â  It probably started back in high school when she was working at Tommy's Fine Office Products in the Arnprior Mall.Â  Anyway, it doesn't matter how it started, to this day she gets absolutely girly at a new pack of gel pens, or coloured paper clips.Â Â 

So, I try to whet her appetite with the good stuff from time to time.Â  For instance, I tried to get her [personalized Sharpie markers](https://www.mysharpie.com/) for Christmas this year but the company won't let me buy them because I don't live in Bush-land.Â  Damned Yanks.Â  Anyway, they are way too cool if you can get them.

Next I think I will try to scare up [some of these](http://www.megasticky.com/index.html), hopefully she's not reading.Â  How cool are they?Â  Huge-mungous post it notes.Â  Totally unecessary, I know.Â  You aren't thinking like Nikki though.Â  I know that a piece of tape on a regular piece of paper does the same job.Â  So does a 1cent Bic pen similarly perform identically to a $7 fancy job, but you can't tell Nikki that.Â  Getting her stuff like this is probably better than bringing home flowers.Â  She's a complex broad.

Fortunately for me, I can keep my finger on the pulse of all things office product by just reading [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com), since they regularly cover all kinds of stuff like this.
