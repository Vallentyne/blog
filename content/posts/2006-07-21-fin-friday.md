This is a family blog of course, so I try to keep the sailor talk to a minimum.  This has to do with the inevitability of one of the kids finding and reading these posts later on, and more or less walking the walk.  So, here's hoping the kids never find this post.

Remember The Big Lebowski?  Bet you never realized how many times they said the F-word in that movie.  Well, check this out.  The [F-ing Short version of the Big Lebowski](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqtgfjkB6Pg).  It's the entire movie edited down to show only the times the actors utter the F-word.  It's pretty good, actually, and it still takes over 2 minutes to get through them all.  They sort of take on a life of their own after a minute, and have a rhythm and patter that is almost hypnotic.  In a sweary, filthy kind of way.

So, there you go.
