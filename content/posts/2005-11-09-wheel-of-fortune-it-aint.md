Liberally stolen from Metafilter where this bizarre clip has been linked to at least three times, it's still inexplicable enough to post here.

A clip from a Japanese game show, or so the Metafilter post said, where in this particular sequence the contestants stick their heads through holes in a table upon which is a hungry lizard, free to roam around.  The only catch is the contestants have raw pork strapped to their heads.

[See for yourself](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-123322263707848424), completely work-safe, as long as excessive Japanese female screaming doesn't bother you.
