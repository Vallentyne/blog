Well that was painful.

Five days into "Operation Big Bed" and we have had to fall back.  Us parents have been worn down by relentless, merciless complaining and whining.  It all fell apart last night at 3am, Quinn woke up for the second time that night to cry and complain for no apparent reason.  I moved the playpen back into his room, put him in it and he immediately went to sleep.  No big bed victories this week, despite a good start on Friday and Saturday night.  We will fall back, plan and regroup for another assault.  There's no shame in living to fight another day.  Children are tough nuts to crack.  They can be implacable, cold, calculating, ruthless.  One look and anyone can see the steely gleam in his eye, the driving force to dominate and rule.
