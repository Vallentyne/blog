Uh, HELLO!  I'm here.  Like, some of us work so I just had time now to join your BLOG thing.  Didn't realize it was such a party!!

In regard to snow shoveling I have been banned b/c of my "delicate" condition (yeah right!) by my hubby.  Just can't help you there Court.

I would attend such a skating party but a) I think I'm too front heavy (have fun with that one!) so I can't skate anyhow and b) there is the matter of about 6 hours between us that's a problem.  We'd totally be at your soirees if we could and you know that, right?
