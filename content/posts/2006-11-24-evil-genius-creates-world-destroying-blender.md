Here's a great angle on marketing your product.Â  [This company](http://www.blendtec.com/) makes incredibly powerful blenders for home and commercial use, they have had some fun around the office by trying to blend lots of things, and someone in the office (very smartly) decides to start taping these things and put them on the web in a sort of video blog.Â  It's so smart, I am jealous.Â  It's entertaining and immediately makes people start talking about your product (which to be honest looks like no other blender I have ever seen, this thing is maniacal) and instantly generates buzz.Â  So smart.

[Have a look at this thing in action](http://www.willitblend.com), it's a little scary how easily it makes dust out of anything; marbles, golf balls, a whole coke can, etc.Â  Too fun to watch.Â  It certainly proves to me just how good these blenders are, that's for sure.Â  I want one, for no real reason other than the ability to make [cochicken](http://www.willitblend.com/videos.aspx?type=unsafe&video=cochicken) whenever I want.Â  Yum.
I saw this first on [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.net)
