So, the boy is sick.  Nikki is sick.  Jordy is complaining of a sore ear.  Yep, sick.  I am still fighting being sick from last week.  I love winter.  We nicknamed Quinn "Glue Stick" because he wipes his nose on everything and leaves a perfect trail of snot that dries to the consistency of cement.  Great.

So, Valentine's day is approaching.  Nikki is waiting with baited breath to see what I will pull out this year.  Ya right.  You would think I would be better at this, wouldn't you?  It's incredible how bad at romance I really am sometimes.  Nik will agree wholeheartedly no doubt.  Poor girl.

On another note, I am trying to get a good way to put pictures up here and I haven't figured it all out yet.  There must be an easy way.  Think man, think.

oh well, you will just have to wait I guess.

Later.
