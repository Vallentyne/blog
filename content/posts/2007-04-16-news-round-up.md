Here's your Monday News roundup.

From the department of futility, it seems that over the last decade the US Government has spent a billion dollars to try to get teenagers to [stop having sex](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/04/16/teens_ignore_abstinence/).Â  Brilliant use of that money, don't they know they have a hugely expensive and incredibly wrong war going on?Â  No not the war on drugs, the other one.Â  No, not the [war on the environment](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/15/warming.military.ap/index.html), [the other one](http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/16/bush.iraq.ap/index.html).

And remember [when](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/04/04/barack-obama/) I [said](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/10/10/stephen-tyrone-colbert/) that using The Daily Show and Colbert for my primary sources of current events was a bad idea?Â  Well it turns out that it may not be such a bad idea, in fact [a recent study](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/business/media/16pew.html) shows that morons like me who watched those shows for news were actually the smarterest people of the bunch, including those who watched regular news shows.Â  Huh, imagine that.Â  I can't wait to see what Colbert makes of that story...

Later folks.
