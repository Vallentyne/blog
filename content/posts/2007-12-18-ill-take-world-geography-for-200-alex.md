Canadians get only a very general overview of World geography in public and high school, so I was sure that I would do very badly at this fun little game.Â  Basically it gives you a country or city or famous landmark and you have to click on a map of the world as quickly and as close to the target as possible.Â  If you think it sounds hard, it's actually way harder than that.Â  Man, am I ever an ignorant git.

Anyway, it's good fun and you might even learn something, I know I did.Â  Like where on the globe Easter Island is.Â  You know, the huge heads?Â  Yeah, where is that?Â  [Good luck](http://www.minijuegosgratis.com/juegos/hwdykyworld/hwdykyworld.html?b415=0766).
