Well yesterday was Cael's first day of junior kindergarten, after an excruciatingly long wait (for him at least) for the "staggered start" business to be done with. Â It went off just fine, although with a typical Cael twist. Â First off, as you can see here, he is absolutely humungous. Â It looks like he has at least 3 inches on every one of his classmates.

Secondly, as he casually mentioned to Nikki and I in passing while eating his lunch after he got home, he apparently had "a time out" on the very first day of school. Â Yes, it seems that he was doing a little too much running when he shouldn't have been and had to be spoken to. Â Now keep in mind there were about 6 students in the class at the time, they are still staggering the starts. Â What kind of mischief do you think will happen once he has a whole class of cohorts?

In any case, he goes back for good on Tuesday, so time will tell.
