One of my favourite authors, [Neil Gaiman](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/) has co-written [a short piece on Wired](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/myth.html) that talks about how Superman is completely different from every other superhero.  It's a really thoughtful piece, going into how Superman became part of pop culture as more of a folk hero than anything else.  I think it's neat, although I am far from a Superman aficionado, so maybe one of those guys would call this crap.
