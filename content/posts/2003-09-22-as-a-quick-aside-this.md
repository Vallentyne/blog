As a quick aside, this is still percolating along, although I heard about it quite a while ago.  Some guy is [suing most of the major fast food chains](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/fatsuit020725.html) because they didn't tell him their food is fattening.

I mean come on.

Best quotes from the article though : "To win his suit he has to convince a jury or a judge that people are too stupid to feed themselves or their children. If people are so stupid, should they be allowed to vote or go to work in the morning?"  I think this has merit, in some cases.  You do have to wonder about some folks sometimes.

Also:  "Another class action law suit claims that the makers of the corn and rice puff snack food "Pirates' Booty" under-represented its fat content by more than 340 percent."

Well, let's see, hmm.  This bag of salted, crunchy, oral fixation pleasers is not as good for me as a shovel-full of barley?  Somebody call the cops!  Do you really need to be told that anything that comes from a greasy plastic bag isn't exactly good for you?

Ahh, god bless America.
