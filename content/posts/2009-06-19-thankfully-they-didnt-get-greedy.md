Remember the case against Jammie Thomas?Â  The single mom of four kids who got sued by the RIAA for downloading some songs from the Internet?Â  The jury came back and [awarded](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2349029,00.asp) the RIAA damages [to the tune of $1.9 million dollars](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/06/riaa-jury-slaps-2-million-fine-on-jammie-thomas/), which works out to $80 000 per [downloaded song](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/10/trial-of-the-ce/).Â  I'm sure that Richard Marx and Reba McIntyre have been waiting for that $80k, which I'm sure they will be seeing very soon.Â  All single mothers of four keep a contingency fund of millions just in case they get caught downloading songs.

The good news is, now that the regular folks see that the RIAA means business, boy, everyone is going to stop downloading music for free for sure.

fyi, that was sarcastic...
