Ahh, it's good to be a geek.

For those of you that care, or pretend to care, Vallentyne.com is now powered by Windows Server 2003 and Exchange Server 2003.  It's mostly RTM code, so I'm told.  Except for Exchange, that's still Beta 2.  This is all good stuff, rock solid so far.  Had a little hiccup on the upgrade but the fresh install went swimmingly.

Note:  Nikki is very patient with the technology at home.  Bless her.

That will be all.
