It's hard to describe how awesome the Internet really is.Â  It's a vast swirling pool of weirdness, but sometimes things align just so and the chance collision of just the right ingredients produces something new and amazing.Â  Take the Three Wolf Moon Shirt, for instance.

All by itself, it is nothing.Â  But, add almost 500 reviews created by random Internet people, some judicious blog coverage (I saw it on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2009/05/21/three-wolf-moon-shirt/)), and suddenly sales of this shirt have risen by 2300%, and the world is made a better place, sauteed in awesomesauce.

I mean it, the world is better because these shirt reviews exist.Â  I love this strange, meaningless, hilarious, brilliant snark.Â  Why would anyone take the time to write a review of a silly shirt?Â  Let alone invest some time and thought into it.

Here are just some of my favourites, they are all great.


<blockquote>So I'm looking for threads that say, "Hey baby...I'm real boss!" when I stumble upon this epic creation. The wolves spoke to me in a language all their own; it was like German, Mongol, and Bitchin all mixed together. I mean, one wolf howlin at the moon is major...but three???

I ordered next-day air (if only there was same day!), and, of course, a size smaller than usual to ensure the closeness of the wolves to my chest hair. When the package arrived, I tore it open, and I SWEAR angels sang. I think it was Freebird. I immediately removed my "No Fat Chicks" shirt, and replaced it with this finery. Lemme tell you: AW YEAH.

I'll spare the details of my conquests since I started wearing this shrit; suffice to say, I'm swimming in a sea of babes the likes of which are usually found on those K-Tel infomercials. I'm also more confident at work, and expect to be promoted to cashier soon. I owe everything to this shirt (I should say "shirts", since I now own 23 of them).</blockquote>


The top rated review:


<blockquote>This item has wolves on it which makes it intrinsically sweet and worth 5 stars by itself, but once I tried it on, that's when the magic happened. After checking to ensure that the shirt would properly cover my girth, I walked from my trailer to Wal-mart with the shirt on and was immediately approached by women. The women knew from the wolves on my shirt that I, like a wolf, am a mysterious loner who knows how to 'howl at the moon' from time to time (if you catch my drift!). The women that approached me wanted to know if I would be their boyfriend and/or give them money for something they called mehth. I told them no, because they didn't have enough teeth, and frankly a man with a wolf-shirt shouldn't settle for the first thing that comes to him.

I arrived at Wal-mart, mounted my courtesy-scooter (walking is such a drag!) sitting side saddle so that my wolves would show. While I was browsing tube socks, I could hear aroused asthmatic breathing behind me. I turned around to see a slightly sweaty dream in sweatpants and flip-flops standing there. She told me she liked the wolves on my shirt, I told her I wanted to howl at her moon. She offered me a swig from her mountain dew, and I drove my scooter, with her shuffling along side out the door and into the rest of our lives. Thank you wolf shirt.

Pros: Fits my girthy frame, has wolves on it, attracts women
Cons: Only 3 wolves (could probably use a few more on the 'guns'), cannot see wolves when sitting with arms crossed, wolves would have been better if they glowed in the dark.</blockquote>


Extra points for the use of "girthy".

You must [go and read them](http://www.amazon.com/Three-T-Shirt-Available-Various-Sizes/product-reviews/B000NZW3IY/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1), the Internet demands it.Â  Then, if you dare, maybe buy a shirt....
