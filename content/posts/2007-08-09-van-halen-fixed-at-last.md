People can be classified into two groups, you are either a Roth or a Hagar.Â  Despite the fact that there has been years of Hagar, not all of them bad, I have always felt most comfortable as a Roth.Â  So it is with great satisfaction that I bring you this news:Â  [Van Halen will be touring with David Lee Roth this fall](http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2007/08/09/4405371-ap.html).Â  Nikki won't be pleased, she's a true-blue Hagar.Â  You might think that the Roth-Hagar split would put stress on our marriage.Â  You would be right, I still bear the scars from our first attempt to "discuss" this matter.

I secretly think Nikki just likes [Sammy Hagar](http://www.redrocker.com/) because of his benchmark 80's hair that everyone wanted at the time.

In any case, now that (maybe) David Lee Roth will actually reunite with the band, the [original line-up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen) is (almost) intact.Â  (Apparently that other guy in the band, the bassist, whassisname, won't be playing)

All is right in the universe.Â  Just don't ask Nikki.
