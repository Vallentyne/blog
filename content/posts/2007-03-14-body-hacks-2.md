Yesterday I read the [most amazing article on Wired](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/bemore.html?pg=1&topic=bemore&topic_set=), I have been talking about it to everyone, and probably boring them to tears with it.Â  It talks about the advanced research projects going on for the American military, finding ways to make their soldiers stronger, tougher, etc.Â  The best part is it's not anything even that creepy, but really logical hacks that have incredible results.

For instance:Â  they have a glove that acts like a radiator for your body, cooling you when you are hot, but also heating you up when you are cold.Â  The results of weight training with this thing are incredible.Â  The lab tech who is working on the project used to do 100 pullups in his normal workout.Â  After he started using this thing to cool down in between sets, he went from 100 to doing over 600 reps in just 3 months time.Â  It turns out that our muscles tire because of overheating, not because of any sugar use or acid buildup.Â  The biologist started using the glove and after four months did 1000 push ups on his 60th birthday.Â  Incredible stuff.

The glove is just one of their tricks, so go and read this article, it's just so cool.
