I am not a fan of Flash websites, as you may [remember](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/wilson_dont_loo.html), but this one is very fun and cool to play with.  An excellent and memorable website, and it's not surprising to know that it's an [ad agency's website](http://www.leoburnett.com/).

Man, that's a neat interface, there's lots to click and play with.  Yes, I'm inconsistent, I know that.  It's part of my charm.
