Man, I'm not one to make much of things in the metaphysical sense, but holy crap it's been a sucky week for aircraft landing gear.  I mean, did the mechanics' union do something bad and now aircraft everywhere are revolting?  

First there was [this one](http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=local&id=3456020), in Smyrna Beach a Cessna had a problem getting the landing gear locked for landing.  The airport guys there came up with the idea of driving along underneath the plane and whacking it with a stick.  That's technical airplane talk, just try to follow along anyway.  It worked and the plane landed safely.

Then, just yesterday there was [another landing gear problem](http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/21/airliner.emergency.ap/index.html) in Los Angeles.  I guess the boys at the LA International airport aren't quite up to the level of the Smyrna Beach guys, because they let the plane circle for hours before just bringing her in to smack down with the flames and the smashing and the screaming.  It skidded to a stop and everybody got out.  I mean, come on, they don't have Jeeps and sticks in LA?  What the hell?

Joking aside, thankfully no one was hurt.
