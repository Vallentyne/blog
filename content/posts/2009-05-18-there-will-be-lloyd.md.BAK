It's done.Â  A recent fit of insanity, and we now own two dogs.Â  Not just any two dogs, of course.Â  Two large dogs.![Lloyd Vallentyne](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/p-604-453-3509b3f9-1dcb-4a9a-b2e1-99cef5d57691.jpeg)


Meet Lloyd.Â  He is basically a stuffed animal that does three things:



	  * captivates anyone who looks at him, piercing their heart with instant love and adoration
	  * while he weighs 20 pounds or so now, there's a sense of looseness about him, like an empty sack just waiting to be filled with muscle and dog food.
	  * he does not sleep at night.Â  No sir.Â  That's when Lloyd practices singing, yelping, yowling, panting, etc.

There is no reason to believe that Lloyd will be anything but humongous.Â  That's why the present is rather hilarious, or will be more so in about 6 months.Â  The hardwood floors are far too slippery for Lloyd, for instance.Â  It's as if we have a baby gate up, he won't willingly walk onto them.Â  Also, he seems very happy to be carried up and down any stairs, for they are far too huge for him to contemplate.Â  They aren't really, but he has no confidence yet, so we carry him most places for now.Â  His paws (which I really have to get a better picture of to show you) are the same size as Harvey's.Â  Maybe not in sheer mass, but in displacement.Â  These paws are made to support a much larger structure than they currently do.Â  It makes me realize that you don't build a bridge from the top down, and the paws are the first thing to swell to enormous size so that the rest of his body can do the same.

He isn't very big on moving around, but when he runs, it's like a bunny rabbit at the moment, rocking forward and back.

You can be sure there will be more of Lloyd (and Harvey) to see here in the coming months as Nikki and I become besotted with him like first time parents again.

Note that in this picture, it's his back paw you can see between his two front ones, and not his willy.Â  This is a family blog, people.
