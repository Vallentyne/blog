I can hardly believe the speculation that [my little comment](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/06/some_things_spe.html) from a couple of days ago about Nikki's news sparked up.  It's amazing what some of your sick little minds cooked up, given a shred of information.  Let me clear this all up right now:

Nikki is not pregnant, people.  Really.  

What I was referring to is the [Cynik.ca](http://www.cynik.ca) business.  Jeez louise.  She and Cindy are really kicking some butt lately.  Now, go back to idle speculation about something else, will ya?
