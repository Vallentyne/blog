It seems that our youngest child has been on a roll lately, thought I would share some of the fun with you.

Cael on eating pizza:


<blockquote>I would like one piece of pizza because I am fit and thin</blockquote>


Cael on receiving his new hockey team toque (which he hasn't taken off his head in the three days since):


<blockquote>Mmmm, it  still has that new toque smell.</blockquote>


Cael giving a mall Santa his modest list of Christmas gift wishes:


<blockquote>An EXACT mannequin of  himself
A jetpack
A skateboard half-pipe
The ability to levitate. </blockquote>


Yes, of course, Santa has a whole WHACK of extra Cael mannequins just LAYING (literally) around.Â  These don't sound like normal 6 year old demands, do they?Â Â  What does a new toque smell like?Â  Will I look back on these things later and hit myself in the forehead and say "It was all right there, why didn't I see the signs he was starting to display super-villain tendencies?".
