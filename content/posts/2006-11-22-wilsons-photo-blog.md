Wilson wrote another post on his photography blog yesterday, this one is about lighting and stuff.  I'm enjoying the posts a lot, they are funny and informative even though I can't keep up technically to the tips.Â  His bit about Cindy is particularly funny, more so if you know her as I do.

Go check it out and learn how to take Matrix-style ninja shots.
