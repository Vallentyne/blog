Oh man, even if this is a hoax, this guy deserves some major credit for doing this in the first place.  The site has a backing story that is self-explanatory, but the most suprising thing I found was his sense of timing for the songs was right on the money, or at least to my ear, and there is no music playing.

Anyway, I have only screened "Whole Lotta Love" so far, but I must say that it is worth the wait right until the bitter end.  You think he's done, but ohhhhh nelly he sure isn't.
