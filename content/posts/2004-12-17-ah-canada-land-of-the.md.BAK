Ah, Canada. Land of the legal pot, legal gay marriage and enemy to the American way of life, as told by the American government. It's really kind of funny if you look at it that way, it never occurred to me that Canada is sliding further away from the US in terms of policy and way of life. Check out [this](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2004/12/15/notes121504.DTL&nl=fix) article (titled Canada Goes to Hell) from a San Francisco newspaper. It's absolutely hilarious, it's especially enlightening to see an American's perspective on Canada, although I'm sure it's a bit exaggerated, or rather I hope it is.

Here's a bit:


<blockquote>After all, unlike the U.S., Canada backed the Kyoto Treaty (along with 165 other heathen nations). They also spend more per capita on education and less on health-care overhead than the U.S. They have a $10 billion federal surplus, a new record. They are not, as of yet, abusing the hell out of their vast natural resources (freshwater, huge forests, oil and natural gas, mineral deposits, etc.) and embarrassing themselves on a global scale every single day and making a mockery of their constitution or their citizens' civil liberties. What the hell is wrong with them?</blockquote>


Pretty good stuff, makes you feel good about being Canadian.
