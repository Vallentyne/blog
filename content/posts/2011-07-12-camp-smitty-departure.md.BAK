So, yesterday we managed to send three kids off to camp for 10 whole days. That's the first time that's happened, and the kids were STOKED. Mom and Dad? Perhaps not as much.

ï»¿Still we felt it was a really good thing to do for our kids, promote their independence, build their confidence, and of course the crazy amount of fun they would have. We spent considerable time making sure we packed every item on the pack list, which will probably turn out to be overkill once we have the benefit of hindsight. That takes a considerable amount of time, as it turns out. And it looks like we are sending them away for a month.

Anyway, the hardest part for us is they are completely, totally, AWAY. We can't easily call, IM, email, poke, Google, FB creep, nothing. We can only write letters. Letters, on a dead tree. On a pure data throughput level, that's like dialing up to the Internet using a piece of yarn instead of a phone line. Honestly, how did anybody get anything done?




So there you go, Nikki and I are dangerously alone for 10 days. Dangerously, quietly alone. I will let you know how it all goes....
