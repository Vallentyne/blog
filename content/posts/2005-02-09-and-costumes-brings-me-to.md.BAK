...And costumes brings me to sewing machines, see how these things all logically follow together?  It's how things work in my brain.  Anyway, I noticed a couple of really cool  sewing machines lately on Gizmodo.  Yes, cool sewing machines, check these bad boys out.
First this one has a colour touchscreen that's pretty neat, but also you can stick a USB thumbdrive in it with any JPG and it will create a pattern for it.  Wow.

Then, this sewing machine actually runs Windows.  It more or less does the same thing as the first one, colour touchscreen and all, but it has a CD drive in it.

When you think about it, sewing machines aren't a very mainstream product, but these things take that way beyond anywhere they have been before.  The first thing I'm imagining will be some enterprising nerd networking these suckers together and really cranking out some volume Star Trek uniforms.  He's standing there rubbing his hands together, cackling to himself as his army of networked computer sewing machines cranks out Starfleet uniforms in perfect unison....

Maybe that was too far.
