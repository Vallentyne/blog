Wow, there's a lot of good stuff in [this article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html) on Wired.  It's all about how online content providers can make big money by offering niche content, instead of the hit-driven culture we have today.  It's really thought provoking, he mentions how if the music companies didn't have to pay for the traditional distribution methods everybody could make exactly what they make today, and the cost of a song online would be around .79c

It's very smart stuff, and covers books and movies as well as music.
