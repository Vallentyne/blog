Some [nutritional information today](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081120.wbeverages20/BNStory/lifeMain/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081120.wbeverages20), as I snarf down some leftover cold pizza for lunch. Â Apparently a new study shows the liquids we drink in a day could add up to another whole meal, if we aren't being careful. Â 


<blockquote>"What you drink is basically the same [amount of calories] as what you eat for lunch."</blockquote>


Some other revelations of the study include: Â teenage boys drink more soft drinks than is exactly a good idea, teenage girls should drink milk more, adults drink too much alcohol and caffeine. Â Not exactly a revelation, perhaps, but good to know. Â 

Then we move onto the coolest cooking utensil I have seen in a while, it's [a hands-free whisk](http://www.cnet.com/8301-13553_1-10098412-32.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=Crave). Â As the reviewer on Boing Boing Gadgets pointed out, it's basically right out of Harry Potter, which is just too cool. Â Not sure how practical it is, since as [the video](http://www.lakeland.co.uk/'stirr'/F/productvideo/12301?returnURL=/'stirr'/F/keyword/stirr/product/12301?src=awdefANDafid=80683ANDafname=!!!name!!!ANDsrc=awdefANDafid=80683ANDafname=!!!name!!!) shows it doesn't really whisk, but rather sort of just rotate around very very lethargically.

Finally, we have something that the kids would probably love, and parents almost universally find revolting. Â [The SpreadHeads](http://thespreadheads.com) are an attachment you screw onto your ketchup and mustard bottle, and then it appears as though the mustard is vomited out of the little guy's mouth, and the ketchup streams out of the other's nose like a nosebleed. Â

Brilliant. Â It's more than a little disturbing, for sure, but the company is missing out on the real marketing angle here. Â Kids are drinking too much soda, right? Â How much soda would you drink if you had to french kiss a little plastic man to drink it? Â Or if you prefer, slurp it right out of a little gnome's nostrils? Â Yum! Â The revulsion factor alone would surely curb even the strongest craving.

Then again, putting a gagging face on a beer bottle probably wouldn't really stop me for long. Â Besides most people make that face when I offer them a 50 anyway....

I should mention that the products mentioned here were seen by me on Boing Boing Gadgets.
