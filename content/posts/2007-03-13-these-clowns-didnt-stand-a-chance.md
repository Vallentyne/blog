First off, we have a quick story from Colombia: an unknown gunman bursts into a circus and [shoots two clowns](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/02/21/colombia.clowns.reut/index.html?eref=rss_topstories).Â  Now I dislike clowns as much as the next dude, but that's just uncalled for.

Then another story of an untimely, but not undeserving, clown death.Â  A bus full of [senior citizens](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/02/22/seniors.mugged.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories) were held up by three hapless cowards.Â  It turns out that these losers were not quite up to the task, since two of them fled when the seniors started to fight back, and disarmed them.Â  The third was put into a headlock by a seriously bad-assed retired Military serviceman.Â  The "senior citizen" broke the man's clavicle and apparently he choked the man to death in the struggle.Â  The seniors were back on their cruise boat by nightfall and cleared of any wrongdoing since they were defending themselves.Â  I love this story, it's got a Hollywood movie kind of feel to it.Â  I'm thinking maybe Tommy Lee Jones, or maybe even Clint Eastwood in the role of the vigilante senior.
