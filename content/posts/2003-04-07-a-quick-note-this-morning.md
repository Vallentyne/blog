A quick note this morning.

Many, many thanks to the Friday night poker club for the help on this weekend's renovations, your assistance was crucial in getting both bathrooms painted and put back together entirely by Sunday night.  The powder room took 3 coats to cover by the way.  Makes one wonder if we should have bothered with two coats of primer under that.  5 coats of paint?  Anyway.

thanks again, Nikki and I really appreciate it.
