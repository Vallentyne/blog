Being a good little capitalist, I am motivated to some degree by money.Â  I'm sure that most of us are in some way, more or less.Â  Money isn't everything, but it definitely helps some things along.

So, I think these two things are very appropriate.Â  First yet another high tech alarm clock, but this time I must say it's got a very good solution to the problem of sleeping in with the snooze button.Â  Basically you configure the [SnuzNLuz](http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/snuznluz.shtml)Â to deduct a preset amount from your account and donate it to a non-profit organization you hate every time you press the snooze button.Â  It connects to the web and yanks real money from your account automatically.Â  As the tagline reads:Â  "Wake up to the smell of...Animosity...".Â  Not a bad idea for chronic snoozers, but there's not much fear of many donationsÂ in my house.Â  Sleep is the scarcest resource there.

Â Then it's off to [stickk.com](http://stickk.com) where you basically wager against yourself that you will achieve a goal.Â  Pick a goal, set a date to achieve it and place a monetary amount against that goal.Â  If you succeed you get your money back, if you fail your money goes either to a charity or to a pre-determined "enemy" of yours.Â  It's brilliant.Â  The idea of entering into a contract with yourself to actually get something done is something I really like.Â  It's not easy sticking to goals sometimes, this definitely takes it up a notch.Â  The best part is you determine a third party referee that is the judge on whether or not you actually succeeded in your goals and has to report in to the website or you have "failed" for that reporting period.Â  Goals are the usual; lose weight, quit smoking, exercise regularly, etc or you can make up your own goals.Â 

I really like this, I have actually signed up and I'm thinking of creating a commitment to get to the gym at least 4 times a week.Â  It's pretty fun, I suggest you give it a try.
