As any Canadian of a certain age can tell you, Kim Mitchell was a key component of adolescence.Â  For a couple of key formative summers Kim provided the soundtrack for many many fun memories.Â  The paradox of having "Go For Soda" [on the same album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akimbo_Alogo) as "Lager and Ale" was mused over many times, usually while drinking one of those three beverages.Â  I will leave it to you to decide which one.

Anyway, it wasn't until 1995 that I think we all realized what a critical component [Peter](http://www.answers.com/topic/peter-fredette) [Fredette](http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/F/Fredette_Peter.html) was to Kim's sound.Â  That's when Kim released a [greatest hits collection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(Kim_Mitchell_album)) that featured a couple of new versions of his classic songs without Peter involved, and to my ears anyway, they just don't work as well.

The only reason I'm writing this right now is this stuff just came on the iPod and for some reason I don't have the original recordings, just the re-worked stuff.Â  I thought a public service announcement was in order, you know just in case you were in the market to buy a 14 year old CD and needed some advice.Â  In my opinion, stay away from this disc and buy the original discs, you will be happier in the long run.Â  Note that the market for potential buyers of this CD who are also readers of this blog is probably very very small.

This irrelevant review was brought to you by the letter "S", Sony Betamax, and MS-DOS.
