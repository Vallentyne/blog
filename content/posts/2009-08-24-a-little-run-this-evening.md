My first run in about 2 years or so, now with iPhone-enabled run tracking.Â  It's a little hard to see, but it took me 34 minutes or so to run 5.48km.  Certainly not breaking any records, but I'm happy with it for my first effort in a while.  

The iPhone tracking is way cool man.Â  Oh, the nerdly joys.
