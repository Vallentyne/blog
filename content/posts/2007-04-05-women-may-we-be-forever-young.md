Courtney and I have just been enlightened lately on Cael's view of women.  

For starters, he is convinced that women don't work.  Obviously I'm not leaving him every morning and saying, "Bye honey, see you after work", like he hears from Court, but it certainly isn't what we are trying to teach.  This became apparent when Cindy dropped over after work.  Cael couldn't wrap his wee head around Cindy having a job.  He laughed and giggled at/with her thinking she was totally playing with him.  Then he dismissed her, completely satisfied with his own conclusion that she must have just come from Robbi's work.  We've been working on that, but I think it will take a while.

Another Cael-ism is that he is convinced that women are not grown ups.  Does this directly reflect my maturity level?  I'm hoping not.  Actually, it finally came out that women are not grown ups, because we can't grow a beard.  Funny how they think eh?

Well, my plan going forward is to work on this women's right to work thing here at home, but I think I may leave the whole women never grow up thing alone.  I'm willing to be forever young in his eyes.

Perhaps this is what they mean when they say, "Kids keep you young".  Amen to that!
