Ah Dylan, ever the sunny and cheerful fella.

Sugar Baby - Love and Theft

There's an uplifting quote.  The song is excellent, a scathing piece that blames his girl for tearing his heart out.  Nikki often makes fun of me for listening to Dylan, she complains that he is bleak and sad, although to be fair she does like "Love and Theft", and "Modern Times" quite a bit.  Those albums are generally more up-tempo band-oriented songs, bluesy and rich.Â  I still like the old whiny Dylan too, and I guess that's just not as universal a thing to like.

Anyway, that's your Dylan for the day.
