Nikki and I have encountered a new problem in parenting; Quinn is now interested in video games.Â  Very very interested.Â  So now we have to decide how to handle it of course.Â  If allowed to, he would probably play for hours.Â  So initially we have decided on time limits, and time of day limits.Â  That's easy enough, but now we have to listen to some whining (to his credit, not that much).Â  The next part will come along soon and it will be what kind of games he can play.Â  Right now I really don't have anything that's gory or too violent.Â  His latest favourite is [The Incredibles](http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/incredibles/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review) for the PS2.Â  I must admit that I had played it initially and been stumped early on since I'm not much of a gamer anymore.Â  Since he has been playing, I have of course been playing with him and helping him along, and I must say the game is really fun.Â  It's the perfect blend of action and non-violence for a kid like Quinn (in my opinion of course, I'm sure there are some people who would be horrified to think he was playing it, but there you go).Â  Sure you punch bad guys and throw them around, but they then fade into the ground and there's no blood or gore at all.Â  Most of the violence is of the cartoon variety, like the movie.

So there you go, I have no idea what we will do next.Â  Jordy was and is too easy, she likes her Dance Dance Revolution, some others, but would usually much prefer to be chatting on MSN with her friends.

This was prompted by reading [this article](http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/commentary/games/2007/04/gamesfrontiers_0409) on Wired this morning.
