Batten down the hatches people, it's getting weird out there.

It seems that some folks have forgotten their meds recently, and they all hang out at McDonald's for some crazy reason.  Or maybe it's that there's something in the food causing all of this?

First off, a[ scary looking lady](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2010/01/04/12341336.html?cid=rssnewsweird%20news) from Ohio who, upon hearing that there weren't going to be any McNuggets, proceeded to punch through the drive through window in a fit of nugget rage.  Um, ya.  This lady likes her nuggets.

And then we're over to [this lady](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2010/01/06/12364161-ap.html?cid=rssnewsweird%20news), who got what she ordered, but then proceeds to trash the place because she was unhappy with her hamburger.  She was offered a replacement burger, but wanted her money back.

Glad to see people are coping with their anger in healthy ways, while eating healthy things.Â  It's a healthy cycle.

Later folks.
