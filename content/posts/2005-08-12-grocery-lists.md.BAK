Well, I must say that this sure makes me feel quite a bit better as a person.  When you think you may be getting a tad neurotic, obsessive, or the like, have a gander at [this site](http://grocerylists.org/) and you will surely feel all better.

Actually, the act of cataloging and rating other peoples' grocery lists may be just a tad left of the beaten path, but if you browse through the lists that are there you can start to see that maybe your life is just peachy compared to some of these shooping folks.

Like the person that felt insecure enough to actually make [this list](http://grocerylists.org/500/Pages/0449.shtml).  I mean, really.  Anyway, somehow this site is really fun.  It shouldn't be, but the brief justifications on the [Top 10 page](http://grocerylists.org/top10/) help in the humour department.
