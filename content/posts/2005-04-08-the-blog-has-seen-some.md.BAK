The blog has seen some turbulent times recently, with the great router outage of February, and the here-it-is, here-it-isn't status of today.  I'm still fighting with the replacement router that bounces up and down like a rubber ball whenever it feels like it.  I have almost developed an affinity for it's quirks, really, like an ugly pet.
But lately the source of my ire has been Blogger, the service I use to post here.  Recently they have been incredibly unreliable, and I think I finally have had enough.  So, I will be (someday soon) working on getting Movable Type installed at home.  This stuff is really really cool, and still free.  It will definitely change the look of the blog, hopefully for the better, time will tell there.  It should also add some neat features, like better image support.  Anyway, watch this space for changes.
