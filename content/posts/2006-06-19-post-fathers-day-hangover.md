I am still coming to terms with being back at work, even though I only took Friday off.  Some weekends are just too good to let go of.  We went to [Cedar Cove](http://www.cedarcove.ca) where we rented a [great trailer](http://www.cedarcove.ca/trailers/e28_1.jpg) for the weekend and had a generally excellent time.  Kudos to my very fine wife for planning and executing this plan perfectly.  It was a bit of a turning point for us also since we brought everybody this time and we all survived the whole weekend, relatively unscathed.  Cael was the camping rookie (although I would never call staying in that trailer camping, it's really very comfortable) and while Friday night was a little dicey (humongous thunderstorm, Cael didn't want to fall asleep, etc.), Saturday went much smoother I think, although I kind of fell asleep at my post with Cael.  I was supposed to be keeping him in bed, but he outlasted me and was still awake after I fell asleep...

Anyway, we are all tired and bugbitten but in the end very relaxed I think.  I will have to ask Nikki again after she gets a little more caught up on her sleep, cause she's a little whipped today I think.  I should have some pictures up soon, stay tuned.
