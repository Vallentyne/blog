Just so you don't think that Wilson has the blog cornered on insightful posts about topical issues, I thought I would give you a little taste of what I've got simmering over here.

I have been reading a quite good blog lately, [WMFU's Beware of the Blog](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/) and they had a post recently that I found funny and interesting.  Basically it's a story about the history of yelling Freebird at any old band at a live show.  It talks about an article in the Wall Street Journal, which I guess is too lame to actually allow you to see the original article without paying and as a result doesn't get a link.  So, it appears that the WMFU guys reprinted the meat of it, and it's pretty funny.  I have heard this cry at many a rock show, and it's somehow funny to hear a drunken redneck shout this every time.  Anyway, there's no insight here on this, I more or less just wanted to share the link with you, [and now I have](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2005/04/the_history_of_.html).
