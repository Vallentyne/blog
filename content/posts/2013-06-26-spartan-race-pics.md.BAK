So, hopefully these areÂ in some sort ofÂ order, here are some pics from the Spartan Race that I thoughtfully yanked from theÂ siteÂ where they post these.Â  I have probably missed several ofÂ folks that I know, but these are the ones I saw at first glance.Â  Handy that we wereÂ wearing those red shirts, they stand out well in the thumbnails.

Needless to say that runningÂ up and down Edelweiss three timesÂ made this thing hard, butÂ having most of the obstacles all at the end of the race was a bit silly.Â  Spreading them outÂ more would have been a lotÂ more fun.Â  I guess it was a problem with the available space they had.

The iced water pool was a nice touch....

The fire jump was neat, and not as scary as it sounds.Â  The brief warmth was very welcome that day.

I look like I'm levitating here.

This montage made me laugh, watch Wilson trying to find any enthusiasm for the rest of this race, anywhere.Â  There's nothing, just nothing.

Ya, just jump, monkey boy.Â  Still contemplating.Â  There may not be any fucks left.

Ya, there's probably at least one fuck there somewhere, if only because it's near the end of the race.Â  Sorry to poke fun buddy....Â  :-)

Not many pics I could find of this ramp thing, but the mud is everywhere, even on the camera lens.....

So there you go, a partial documentation of the day.Â  It was fun, cold, and oh so dirty.Â  I probably won't do it again and just stick to road races for now, but I am glad I did it.
