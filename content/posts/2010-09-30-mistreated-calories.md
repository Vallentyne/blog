I am certainly blessed with good genetics as far as my weight goes, I have a great metabolism that hasn't slowed very much so far. I will confess that while I enjoy exercise for the health benefits, my ulterior motive for exercise is to treat calories with utter disdain. I don't eat too much fattening food, but I exercise so that when I do, I can pretty much just sneer at that Big Mac without any form of remorse at all. I exercise so I don't have to care about those two beer, those four mini chocolate bars, and that pound of butter I ate last night.
I don't respect calories at all. Never mind that I am undermining my own efforts when I do this, it's one of the worst forms of discrimination, it's calorieism.

My name is Courtney, and I am a calorieist.

Most folks have a lot more respect for calories than I do, I know that.Â  I need to change my perspective a bit, and put myself in their shoes for a bit.Â  Everybody hates them, the fewer calories there are, the better for most people.Â  Poor little buggers.Â  I should kiss and make up with this lemon poppyseed cake from Starbucks.Â  A little peace offering.

Nope, didn't work.Â  I still ate it with a sneer.

Sigh.Â  It's a long road.
