It seems that a man in Connecticut (a state so confused it's very name is an oxymoron) decided to show up at his dental appointment ready to go, with [the exception of his clothes](http://www.connpost.com/ci_12770272?source=most_viewed). After the receptionist screamed (really?) he ran away, apparently back home where he tried to pretend he was asleep at home the whole time.Â  Um ya.

I tried to come up with an appropriate dental related pun here, and the best I could do was something about "filling a cavity", or "trust me, this won't hurt a bit", or possibly something to do with drilling (wink wink, nudge nudge), which didn't seem appropriate for the family blog.Â  Any suggestions?

I myself have a dental appointment on Monday that I'm not looking forward to, although I'm thinking that being naked isn't going to make it any more fun.
