As March rolls onward, and I am [still working](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/03/11/been-on-the-job-too-long-2/) and working, the kids have found a new level of acceptance of this new "normal".Â  Nikki was putting Cael to bed last night and he asked where Dad was.Â  Nikki answered that I was at work and would be home soon.Â  (That answer is probably ingrained into their heads so that they don't even hear it anymore)Â  Cael responded with disbelief:Â  "pah, you shouldn't work at night!"

Amen, little buddy.
