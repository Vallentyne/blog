Ok, so I will probably never see it, but man this is a funny movie trailer.Â  I mean there's just no way you could take this sort of thing seriously, but they give it a good try.Â  I especially love the implied and oh so scary man-sheep that's hinted at.Â  I wonder how that happened....Â  oh wait no I don't.Â  Kyle, this is your worst nightmare.
