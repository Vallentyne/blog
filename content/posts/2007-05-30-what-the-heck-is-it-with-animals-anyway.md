Animal round-up time.  Here are some things I have stumbled across in the last while....



	  * Defanged c[obra meets one tough baby](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d3b_1178524471&p=1) (from Metafilter).
	  * [Embarassed lion looking stupid in a tub](http://www.neatorama.com/2007/05/29/lion-in-the-tub/) (from Neatorama).  That guy is definitely on the to-be-munched-later list.
	  * [Sea lion does a lap in a kids' walk-a-thon](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/05/13/walking.sea.lion.ca.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories) (CNN).
	  * Octopi are [freaky freaky weird](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TableOfMalcontents/~3/117744233/morning_thing_m_1.html) (Table of Malcontents).
	  * [Jellyfish Lake is extra deathy](http://www.neatorama.com/2007/05/20/jellyfish-lake/) (Neatorama).  This reminds me of that scene in Finding Nemo....  I have kids, go figure.
	  * [Bed Leopard](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/05/28/leopard.jerusalem.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories) (CNN).  Guy wakes up to find a leopard in his bed, wrestles leopard in his jammies, leopard gives up.
	  * [Mice may have the cure for baldness](http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/05/17/baldness.study.reut/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)....(CNN)
	  * And the money shot.... the [chicken EATING spider](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/deepjungle/episode2_nicholas.html) (PBS via Metafilter)

Man, animals are strange animals, eh?
