Thoughts on my birthday:

I realized a few days ago that I had been thinking I was one year older than I actually was all this year. So now that I actually am turning a year older, it's like a do over, and I find it strangely anticlimactic. Maybe that's just good luck for me, but there's a sense of timelessness about it all.

Anyway other than that, there's not much I have to say except thanks to Nikki and the kids for this morning's wishes.  And of course then there's a super-special dinner that Nikki is working on as I write this.

And now that I'm finishing this post, I see that Nikki got fooled by the draft post...  funny stuff.  Sorry baby.
