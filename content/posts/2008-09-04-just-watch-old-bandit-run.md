Some very sad news this week, [Jerry Reed passed away](http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/02/obit.reed.ap/index.html).

Â 

I'm not a country music fan in any modern way, but the old timey stuff is still very fun. Â His songs are some of the most memorable and funny of that time, and [as we saw](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/03/21/im-an-ipod-guy-as/) I listen to his stuff from time to time. Â
