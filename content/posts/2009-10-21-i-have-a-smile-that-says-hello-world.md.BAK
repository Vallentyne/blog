...may I charm the bejeesus out of each and every one of you?

![It's Showtime!](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/p_640_480_87D62A4F-7703-4808-B132-7E7127F3E917.jpeg)


I for one will not be surprised if Cael goes into the performing arts because he can strike a picture perfect pose (see above), absorb and deliver killer lines from movies and TV, and have us all laughing til our guts burst with his rubber facial expressions.Â  If he doesn't do acting, or dancing, then he will move on to sales where nobody's money will be safe from this kid.Â  Look at this picture, it was a spontaneous shot, he grabbed my sunglasses and put them on, and I said give me a cool guy pose and snapped this with the iPhone.Â  It's killing me.

It's certainly his superpower.
