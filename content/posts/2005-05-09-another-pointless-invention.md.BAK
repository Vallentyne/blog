Link to an article about the "[hottest sauce science can make](http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2005211088,00.html)".  It's the "logical" conclusion to the macho game of finding the hottest sauce (I think this more or less falls into the "Poison" category of substances rather than "Food" but that's just me) that can be found.  I guess to be more accurate you would say it's the least lethal substance that can be legally sold as a sauce.

There's no good reason to invent something like this....  I can't imagine what sort of eating habits somebody would have to have in order to think this was a good idea.

It would be far easier to just set your tongue on fire with naptha every time you took a bite of something.  I mean, the testers were literally blinded for 30 minutes after tasting this stuff.  They have a moronic-o-meter to measure how hot these things are in relation to each other.  The world's hottest pepper measures 570 000 on this scale, while this stuff hit 16 million.  The creator mentioned it was "like getting your tongue hit with a hammer".

It's poison, people.  Are we all blind?
