A trio of Chihuahuas wereÂ born without front legsÂ due to a birth defectÂ from over-breeding, and were rescued and adopted by what must be a very patient vet.

I'm not sure what the predominant emotion [this story](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/01/12/chihuahuas-on-wheels/) generates for me, it's either sadness that these dogs have been deformed by human greed, or the fact that I can't look at them without thinking of those rats on the Muppet Show.Â  I mean, especially when they are hopping (pathetically) around on their hind legs, they reminded me strongly of Rizzo with his quivering ears, spindly appendages, and skittish demeanor.Â  See for yourself, there's a strong resemblance there I think.

Anyway, [the story here](http://www.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/ny-lidogs0112,0,7879442.story?coll=ny_home_rail_headlines) is the fact that they have been given custom made carts that let them wheel around horizontally instead of hopping like a kangadog, which they do with reasonable dexterity.Â  Check out the video, they do pretty well for two legs.Â  Kangahuahua?Â  Chigaroo?

Anyway, looks like they are doing just fine in spite of their health issues, and they are cute but only because they have a slight pathetic sympathy thing going for them.
