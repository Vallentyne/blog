Inexplicable [wristwatch ](http://www.ohgizmo.com/?p=510)that practically screams "Don't ever sleep with me" to the opposite sex.  Not only is it shaped like a rotary-dial phone thingy, it doesn't actually tell the time until you dial "117" and then a woman's voice TELLS you the time.

The clever societal comment is lost on me.  It's not like a large number of people regularly used those voice-time services.  The rotary dial thing was done way cooler by [these guys](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/Port-O-Rotary/portable-rotary.htm) anyway, with a much funnier in-joke, where you carry this old black phone around and answer calls on it all day.
