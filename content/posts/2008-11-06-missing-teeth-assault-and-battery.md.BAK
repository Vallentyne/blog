Not that I would want to perpetuate any stereotypes, but it seems that this [whole story started in a mobile home](http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/oct/31/311634/tampa-police-womans-missing-teeth-gum-relationship/). Â Here are the Cole's notes.

She asked him where her teeth were, he said he didn't know. Â She didn't believe him.

...

He body slams her onto the floor. Â She grabs kitchen knife. Â Chases him outside. He sneaks back inside. Â She stabs the knife through the bathroom door, doing her best Jack Nicholson from The Shining, and insists that she will kill him if he doesn't tell her where the teeth are.

...

Police arrive, arrest both of them, find teeth behind the TV stand, beside the remote they probably fought about yesterday.

They are both in jail now.

Â 

The End.
