Hi Everybody!

A Romanian doctor has been ordered to pay a man a (rather low in my mind) amount of $795,000 for accidentally [severing his penis](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/07/04/6064786-ap.html) during an operation on the man's testicles.

.

Oh man, where to begin here?Â  Aside from me making a mental note to avoid going to the doctor while in Romania, I find myself powerless (trying to avoid the use of the word impotent) to come up with an appropriate joke here.  Fortunately, the Associated Press wrote the joke for me.


<blockquote>The victim's lawyer said you don't have to be an expert to realize that the 33-year-old victim isn't in a good state of mind.</blockquote>


That would about sum it up.
