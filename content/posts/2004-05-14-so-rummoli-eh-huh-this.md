So, Rummoli eh?  Huh.  This ought to be good.  There are about 8 of us playing tonight which leaves us all six or seven cards to make a good poker hand out of.  Depending on who deals will determine who gets those extra cards.  Could work for, or against you.

All that is to say, the likelihood of getting the piece of the pie marked 7-8-9 is not looking good.  This means that if it happens, no one will be able to stand the smug bastard that rakes in the mound and cleans us all out.

Rummolio Grabanickel, keep your grubby fingers to yourself I say!

AND...I can't wait to see what kind of rummoli paraphernalia Lockrey brings to the table tonight.  I'm on the edge of my seat.
