So, kids are pretty amazing.  I would probably have laid in bed and milked the operation sympathy like nobody's business, but Quinn was up and at 'em this morning like there's nothing going on.  He was just great yesterday, and was a real trooper when the doctor's came for him beforehand.  He was helped with a little "happy juice" mind you, and was singing bawdy sea chanties at the top of his lungs and goosing nurses, it was quite the scene.  It took two orderlies to get him off the top of the lunch cart and into the operating room, mashed potatoes everywhere.




After he came out he was pretty quiet, and happy to just cuddle, which is pretty much what we did all day and watch movies.  This is of course the abridged version of the day, there was a lot of other details, but they aren't terribly important now that he's ok.




So, all things considered it went extremely well.  Thanks a lot to those of you who called to find out how things went, that's really nice to know everybody was thinking of him.
