Took a little blog break there, myself.  It seems that I'm letting the kids down by always forgetting to fix the darn server when I get home.  Bear with me, folks, it will trickle through eventually.

One thing I have noticed that's kind of interesting is watching Wilson mesh his environmental technologist education with his current job of web site monkey.  It's great to get the alternative news from Wilson, he probably comes across some pretty interesting stuff all the time in the normal workday.  Robbie you need to post these little snippets of subversive culture to the blog too, it's better to have a platform on which you can place your soapbox, right?  I mean he's practically a snake oil salesman already.  I give you:

Must be how he won the lovely Ms. Lockrey, sheer charm.... well, that and his righteous fur coat.
