This morning, for no reason I can determine, I discovered that my brain has been storing all of the words to this song in my head for the past 20 years.Â  I was singing it over and over in the shower, it drove me crazy.

I even remembered the lightning part, and the band guy forgetting his hat.

I now know why when I go to the store for three things I often come home with only two things and the nagging feeling I have forgotten something.

Why would I hang onto that particular bit of information?
