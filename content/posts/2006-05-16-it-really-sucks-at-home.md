Vacuum cleaners.  Man do I ever hate vacuum cleaners.  They are as obnoxious as they are necessary.  We have had the same vacuum for a few years now, and Nikki and I don't exactly agree on whether or not it does a good job.  I think it's fine and does a good job.  She doesn't exactly agree.  

That discussion became moot since recently it was rather broken, albeit accidentally (or so I'm told).  So, it didn't take long for us to investigate and jump right into the purchase of a central vac system.  Anyway, today was the day it was installed and needless to say Nikki called to tell me that this thing is downright deadly as far as suction goes.  A small amount of vacuuming was enough to show just how much dog hair the old vacuum wasn't getting.

So, I stand corrected.  Now we are almost, not quite fighting to see who gets to vacuum.  Man, it's weird getting old.
