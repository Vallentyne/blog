Some new family pictures up on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com), not much but just to keep you in the loop as to what the kids look like these days.  I was going to put Cael's picture up on Flickr too, but, well I exceeded my space limit so I had to put it here.  He takes up a little more room than the other kids, as you can see.
