Would you look at the size of that Jesus?

A 33 meter Jesus is being built in a Polish town. Â There isn't much more, except that locals don't see much value to having such a big Jesus.

Hopefully this particular Jesus won't be [smoten like Touchdown Jesus](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2010/06/15/this-just-in-god-smites-jesus/) wasÂ only a few months ago. Â Have we not learned? Â Looks like another smiting is in the cards. Â Stay tuned.
