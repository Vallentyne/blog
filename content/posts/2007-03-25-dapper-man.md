There are some pictures of the vow renewal after party [here](http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/32505@Z01), unfortunately I am really stupid and forgot to give the camera to somebody, so we didn't get any of the actual service.  I particularly like this shot of Mr. Quinn just before the event.  He's quite the looker, I think.

I'm toying with a new photo website, it's called Zooomr, and it's a carbon copy of Flickr except it's not bugging the hell out of me to do things I don't want to do.  As a result, I may be changing the photo badge on the left at some point, once I have enough shots up at Zooomr.Â  I just realized that I have just uploaded some very low resolution pictures there, so I now have to fix that or Wilson will berate me.
