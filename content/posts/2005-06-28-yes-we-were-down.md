Ok, I had a little fit there for most of yesterday.  I was having one of my by-now-familiar rants about consumer grade DSL routers, ran out last night and bought another one, when all along it turned out to be a (ahem) billing issue with the ISP.  Now it wasn't a very good way to handle it on their part, but I can appreciate how from their perspective I was non-responsive.

Anyway, we're back now, and I'm a little poorer for the whole thing.  Couldn't resist getting [a new rig](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=014) for the office PC at home.  Verry nice.  And I know I'm a geek, but if you can't take pride in your work, why bother?

It's like Pimp My Ride for geeks.
