So, I might have mentioned last week that I was excited about the new Windows Phone update.Â  Well, it showed up bright and early Monday morning, and it was absolutely worth the wait.

Cortana is the biggest feature delivered by far.Â  It's Microsoft's answer to Siri and Google Now, but absolutely holds her own and more.Â Â ConsideringÂ it's BRAND new this is an amazing feature that is able to compete very well indeed with the other players in this area that have had 2 years or more to come up to speed.Â  Have a look at [this showdown ](http://gizmodo.com/cortana-vs-siri-vs-google-now-the-ultimate-voice-con-1562935258?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_facebook&utm_source=gizmodo_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow)to see what I mean.

Even more than that, the <del>Word Flow</del> Shape Writing keyboard is something I never really knew I was missing (something like this has been available as an Android app for a while) until you use it.Â  It's nothing short of incredible to use.Â  The unbelievable accuracy of my random swiping around is literally amazing.Â  It's already won a Guinness World Record, if that's your thing.

Anyway, it's just way too much fun for a geek like me to play with, and there's more to come since it's all just a developer preview...
