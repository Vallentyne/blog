Since Nikki and I and some other folks have been doing P90x for a little while (a very little while for Nikki and I due to last week's craziness) the lowly push-up has really become a large part of our fitness routine recently.Â  The New York Times recently ran a piece on how good [an indicator of fitness the push up really is](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/health/nutrition/11well.html?em&ex=1205553600&en=43b8530ee36900ef&ei=5087%0A).Â  The general idea is that you should be doing push ups (and strength training in general) well into your golden years since the strength you maintain will be exactly what you need to break a fall.Â  Makes a lot of sense.

Â Anyway, it has a good quote from Jack Lalanne (old-timey fitness guru on TV)


<blockquote>

â€œThat way I can go way down, even lower than if I was on the floor,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s really tough.â€</blockquote>

Tony Horton would be proud.Â  Or maybe Jack would be proud of Tony...?
