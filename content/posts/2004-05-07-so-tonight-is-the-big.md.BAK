So tonight is the big bash at Robbi & Cindy's place.  Well done.  We are fortunate enough to have Jane & Whit come by tonight to sit for us so that we may attend said function.  Thanks guys!

On another note, Quinn's Old Navy track pants, size 18-24months are ever so slightly, just a smidge, but not that you would notice, too short on him this week.

So what, right?

Well, I put them on Cael this morning for sh@%s and giggles and well...FITS LIKE A GLOVE.

(Sigh.)  Did I mention that today Cael turns 4 months old?!?!?!?!?

That is all.
