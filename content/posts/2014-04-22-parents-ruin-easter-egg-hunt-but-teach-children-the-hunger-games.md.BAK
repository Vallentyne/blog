In what sounds like a fantastic display of appropriate grown-up behaviour, apparently a public Easter Egg hunt in Laval descended into chaos and anarchy as 10 000 people literally jumped a fence to start the hunt ahead of the proscribed time, with the following description from the CBC:


<blockquote>Displeased with the delay in the startÂ of the hunt, some parents disassembled the fence, causing both children and parents to lurch forward ahead of the scheduled depart time.

â€œThe hunt was supposed to start at noon, but some people arrived at 9:30 a.m. and got impatient,â€ said Cocothon organizer Angella Pattas. 

â€œIt was really the beginning of the loss of control.â€

Some children got pushed over as others ran forth to scoop up plastic eggs containing treats.

Other youngsters came away with nothing â€” especially after some parents snatched eggs out of other childrenâ€™s baskets to give them to their own kids.

Luckily, no one was injured.</blockquote>


Yep, nobody was injured, except civility, common sense and good judgment.Â  Clearly those casualties were evident at this event.

Obviously if there IS a time where knocking children to the ground in a mob-maddened scramble for a few cents worth of shitty chocolate is perfectly fine, it must be at Easter time.Â  You would never get away with this kind of crap at Halloween, hip-checking little Disney princesses and Spidermen out of the way to get some Twizzlers.Â  Nossir.Â  That's a refined, proper holiday.
