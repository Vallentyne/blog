Ok, so I'm procrastinating from doing any work because I am a jerk like that. Â So, how about a new theme for the blog? Â Sure why not? Â Don't tell Nikki that I haven't billed anybody this afternoon yet.

I got bored of the last theme, which while it was clean, started to feel rather bland. Â This is a bit better, I think. Â There is no point for this post, except just for my own purposes. Â Here's to procrastination!

Cheers.
