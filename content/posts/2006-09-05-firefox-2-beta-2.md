Just installed the updated [beta 2 for Firefox 2](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonecho/releases/2.0b2.html), and they finally fixed something that I have long thought was broken.Â  I thought it was broken, but I didn't complain to anybody or try to fix it myself of course, that would be way too proactive and helpful.Â  They have fixed the "which tab am I looking at" problem.Â  Before this build, and I think for most every version of Firefox the current tab was hard to distinguish from the background tabs.Â  Now the current tab is clearly "bolder" and the background tabs are faded out a bit, it really takes the guesswork out.

That's a good fix to an annoying time waster that really bugged me quite a bit.
