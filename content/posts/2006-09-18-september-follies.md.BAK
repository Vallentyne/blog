It is probably lucky for most that I rarely chime in on the blog as sleep deprivation has burned me out of any functioning brain cells it would seem.  More below on that.

Perhaps with 4 hours a week of 3 children in school at the same time I'll find myself with an abundance of spare time to regale you all with the daily happenings of the family.  Oh!  HA!  Wait now, ... my stomach...ha ha...ha!  Sorry I digress.

I highly doubt that you will hear much more from me now than in the past but I'm happy to be making my somewhat annual contribution now.  This week in a nutshell has been nothing short of insane.  We've had something every night of the week, and one wedding to attend on Friday and one that I stood in on Saturday.  2 birthday celebrations, one at each of the mother-in-laws houses for Court (Happy 34th my baby!) and one pitiful attempt at birthday celebrations here at home...just after work...and pathetically squeezed in before swimming lessons commenced at 6:30PM on Wednesday evening.  I am very grateful to Mom and Mummsie for being so thoughtful for Court this week as I have been spread so incredibly thin.

Things I've learned this week.



	  * It is important to sign on for your duties right at the beginning of school so you at least appear keen to the teachers at the onset.  That way you have a leg to stand on later when your obvious foul-ups follow in the days to come.  (just wait...it's coming)
	  * Play dough when made in a quadruple batch is surprisingly easy.  Sign up for that before taking on something else.   Cream of tartar however is $5/tin.  You'll need two for four batches.  Playdough could be potentially cheaper to buy at the dollar store, but that isn't what the school wants... Noooooooooo.
	  * Do not run for a calculator in the office and get side tracked with an email while leaving two children with preschool scissors and paper at the kitchen table.  The end result will be a "New" version of the "back to school haircuts" you paid for not 2 days before.
	  * Preschool scissors cut hair with great ease.
	  * Do not attend two weddings in one weekend and expect your Monday to run smoothly.
	  * Read your school paperwork (over again) every night before waking up in the morning and assuming you have your act together.  One may be apt to assume silly things, like regular school attendance for Quinn might actually start ON A MONDAY!  Poor kid was dressed, gelled and at the bus stop five minutes early this morning before mom had her third sip of coffee and realized that he shouldn't be the only kindergartener at that stop.  Back home we go, by "walk of shame" in front of all the neighbours, mom reads the paperwork that came to her dated June 2006 (thank God I kept it) stating that their first day of regular attendance commences on TUESDAY!
	  * When looking at houses for a lark, be sure to FORWARD all comments to your husband about your lack of enthusiasm about a certain home, and dinner plans.  DO NOT hit REPLY to your real estate agent.

Well folks, this was a really long one, sorry!  It is my somewhat annual post though, so it was bound to be long.Before I sign off though,


HAPPY BELATED PUBLIC BIRTHDAY WISHES to my soul mate on Friday September 15th.  I love you honey, heart body and soul.

CONGRATULATIONS to Perry & Michelle McGregor on their nuptials this past Friday September 15th!

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY to Tanya & Dennis Pilon on their 6th wedding anniversary also on Friday September 15th.

CONGRATULATIONS to Stacey & Mich Bottema for their nuptials this past Saturday September 16th!  Thanks for letting me be a part if it. I was so proud to stand with you.  All my love and support always.
