As I [mentioned a few days ago](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/09/01/stick-a-fork-in-summer/), school time is a magical time for children and parents alike, but mostly parents.  Jordy is in Grade 6 this year, and she is by now used to the beginning of school, an old hand.  It shows in this diva pose at the front door; "I've got people to impress here, Mom.  Make it quick..."

For the boys of course it's brand new and pretty fun.  Quinn is caught up in the staggered start problem of kindergarten.  He is one of those kids that would have been extremely ready to roll on the very first day without any delay, but now he has been forced to wait until Thursday this week before he can go in, and even then he doesn't go back until the following Monday.  It's torture for a kid who I thought would have done just fine in school a year ago...

As for Cael, today was his first day in the staggered start, and he had a great day from all accounts so far.  You can see that he was really really ready to roll.

He had a great time as it turned out and Nikki is even now making Play-Doh as we speak to make amends for the amount Cael ate today....

I kid, I kid.Â  I will have Quinn's debut pictures up just as soon as they let him go.
