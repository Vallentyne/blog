Thanks for the invite Alison.  We aren't fans like you guys but we do enjoy seeing the photos!  Actually my parents attempted to visit like Nik & Court did right before that freak ice storm.  Needless to say my Mom was eager to assign a new visit weekend and they chose Easter so they're on the way here tomorrow.  It'll be great b/c they haven't seen me since I've been showing.  Speaking of which - I need a new date from the Vallentyne's too - the 1st 2 weekends in May are still open for us...  Must run - thanks again and have fun!
