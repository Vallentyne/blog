I see things on the Internet.  Some things I wish I could un-see.  Some things I mention here.  This I will mention because it's deeply weird, and makes me grossed out and compelled to look at the same time.  It's a [photoshop contest](http://www.freakingnews.com/Mouth-Eyes-Pictures--1741.asp) where you replace the person's eyes with little versions of their mouth.  The closed-mouth ones are not as effective as the open-mouthed ones.

This is my favourite, I think, mostly because Keith looks exactly the same.

There are PAGES of these, enjoy.  I saw this first on [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/67731/Photoshopped-pictures-of-people-with-mouths-instead-of-eyes).
