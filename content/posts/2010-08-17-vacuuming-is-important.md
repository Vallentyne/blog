Ok, so 220lbs+ of dog can generate a fairly significant amount of hair. Â Sadly, this represents about three weeks worth of vacuuming, but does not represent the amount of hair I remove by brushing in that same amount of time.

Wow. Â Ick.




This is why we vacuum a lot before people come over. Â Be glad we do, people.
