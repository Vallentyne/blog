Since I'm more or less in the IT industry the word "outsourcing" is a point of interest to me.

Here's an [interesting little angle ](http://techdirt.com/articles/20040719/0033252.shtml)on outsourcing in the restaurant business.  In a nutshell, when you are in the McDonald's drive-through at Girardeau, Missouri and place your order, you are actually talking to someone 900 miles away in a call centre in Colorado.  It's meant to take the errors out of ordering.  That's a little extreme.

Bear with me for a minute here people.

What happens when they ask you to pull ahead and they run your food out to you since it might take too long to prepare?  Do they air drop it in using a military chopper?  Why would you even need to have a drive through speaker phone anywhere near a restaurant?  Just stick them at stop lights anywhere in the city, place an order while you're waiting for the light to go green, and they'll deliver it to you at the next stop light.  Via dogzooka, or whatever those hot-dog firing air guns they have at hockey games are called.  Please remember to open your window before arriving at the light, sir.  You don't want to get any of that vanilla shake on your car's paint, it will strip it right off.  But don't worry if your limbs are too fat and weak to safely catch projectile Big Macs, flash your lights so that we can have one of our McHomeless People (tm) run it over to you through traffic.

Ok, that was a little over the top.
