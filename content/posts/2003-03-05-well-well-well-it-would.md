Well well well... it would appear to the staff of VTI that the president has more time on his hands than the rest of us. For the next few minutes the CFO, Sanitation Staff, Accounting, Business Development and Administration Departments are all on a simultaneous break to place a posting on the supposed "Business/Family" site. So here I am. Now, let's make on thing perfectly clear, silence is not consent Mr. President. You were ahead by a mere 1/4 of a shot by my recollection which last I checked was not a "wide margin". This is why I am the CFO, clearly. All kidding aside, we stopped drinking because we were too tired, and not because we were smashed unfortunately. Our president can talk a big talk when there was not a soul in site to back him up on these ludicrous statements being made. Actions speak louder than works I would imagine, like at every single party we've ever had in the last four years. Out-drink me! Honestly. But I digress.

On another note or two... Valentine's Day was wonderful. I really enjoyed the Blue Rodeo concert with some close friends despite the traveling horn section they had with them. The Keg Manor was also wonderful. All and all, Court managed to put the Vallentyne in Valentine's Day. (Cheesy, I know. This is why my postings are few and far between.) Our anniversary was also wonderful. If you are ever in Kingston definitely stop in at Minoï¿½s for a bite. Well worth it.

Watch Signs. Truly a good flick. Hopefully I won't take so long next time to make a posting. Seems like whenever there is a lull at this end, our President starts the trash talkin'.

Later people!
