I was just reading more damning evidence that we're on the highway to climate 
[hell](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1103AP_Britain_Climate_Change.html). Predictably my blood started to boil.

It really is the beginning of the end. By all scientific accounts,
the polar ice caps will be gone within the next hundred or so years.
Temperatures will have risen several degrees in the same time. With all that
extra water the oceans are predicted to rise up to 20 feet (depending on the
article you read). This will dramatically reduce our landmasses, further
crowding us inland. Add on top of this that a lot of the remaining land will
be uninhabitable due to the risen heat and the constant scouring by never
before seen titanic storms, hurricanes and tornadoes. A lot of already
over-crowded countries won't have enough room for their people. This 
will initiate countless wars of "national survival", which will actually be good
news because it will eliminate much of the overcrowding through war related
fatalities. But, then, wham! Hey! Where did all our fresh water go??? You
mean it doesn't magically appear from some mystical fountain? Nope. Sorry
'bout your luck. 77% of surface freshwater is stored as ice and 22% as
groundwater and soil moisture. The remaining freshwater, making up less than
1% of the world total, is contained in lakes, rivers and wetlands. And what
do you think replenishes those lakes, rivers, underground aquifers that we
rely on so? Yep, ice cap runoff. Oh, rain does it too thankfully. Oh, but
we've f**ked that up too with acid rain. So we just melted our major source
of fresh water which is now nicely salinated in the oceans and are, ever so
busily, poisoning the rest. So, as the rivers, lakes and aquifers deplete, the
toxic chemicals will further concentrate. Unlike water, which can go away and
not come back, the chemicals tend to want to overstay their welcome. Where do
you think that leaves the land? Poisoned. Infertile. Dead.

So, after thinking about the previous scenario, I'm starting to change 
my mind about the whole stopping green-house gas issue. Maybe I've
been looking at this the wrong way. Maybe, I'm going to start siding with the
oil companies and maybe our next vehicle will be a big, square, cast iron
vehicle that has to haul around a trailer with an extra enormous fuel tank
because it gets 0.2 km/litre. Better yet, lets lobby the auto industry to develop
a vehicle that runs directly on a gelatinous slurry of local purÃ©ed flora and 
fauna. Yeah, that's the ticket.

The way I'm starting to see it is thus: We're never going to clean our act up 
enough to save ourselves. It's just too late for that. Humans as a whole 
have been too cursed with a deadly mixture of intelligence,  a supreme lack of
wisdom/foresight, and an unhealthy dose of complacency to set this all right. 
This couldn't be more apparent in our leaders. The world is ruled by a 
bunch of retards who couldn't pull their collective heads out of their collective 
asses long enough to be aware of the world  they're supposedly responsible for. 
That and they all, 100% of them, care for only one thing: the economy. 
How much mental effort does it take to come up with the simple logic that 
without a world in which to live, money doesn't really do anyone any 
good. But, you might as well tell people the oceans are red. Oh, wait! 
They ARE (red tide)! Or that the skies are green.ummm, yep, it more and more 
looks pretty greeny/grey with P.A.N.'s (Peroxy Acetyl Nitrates) which are just 
one element of the chemical stew we vomit into the atmosphere on a daily basis.

And don't get me started on illness. Where do you think most of our illnesses come
from? Alot of it, maybe MOST of it is self inflicted. That's why I only, ONLY donate 
to environmental charities. Lets fix the cause of the problem not put a bandaid on it.

Yep, I've concluded that we're a species that was not meant to survive long in
the evolutionary scheme of things. We're inherently murderous, rapacious and 
egocentrically driven to exploit every natural resources purely for profit and without 
any thought to consequence. The ubiquitous comparisons between humans 
and cancer or viruses are extremely apt. We move into an area, use every 
resource available until there's nothing left and then move on to the next area. 
In fact, there is little we do as humans that doesn't involve destroying something. 

With that in mind, I've pretty much decided to be anti-environmental. The sooner our
species is wiped off the face of the planet, or at least wiped out to the
point where we can't hurt anything anymore, the better. Our tenure on earth
has been one unmitigated natural disaster since we started. We've ravaged,
raped or murdered almost everything there is that's beautiful on the planet. I think
we've proven ourselves time and again manifestly unworthy to hold the top 
seat on earth. Lets just get it over with. I'm sure with us gone, the environment will
recover fully in time. Maybe if we kill ourselves quickly enough some other
wiser, more intelligent life form will take over with better success...maybe
the dolphins will get it right.

Happy Armageddon, everyone!

P.S. I'm, of course, just kidding about becoming anti-environmental. I'm
just gonna become more rabid about it, and less humanitarian.
