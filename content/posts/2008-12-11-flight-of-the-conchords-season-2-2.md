Well it took a while, but season 2 of [Flight of the Conchords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Conchords) is starting January 18th! Â In the true spirit of the Internet they are asking for fan-made videos of [people lip-synching to Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenocerous](http://flightlipdub.com/). Â The best will be shown on one of the new shows... Â Pretty cool stuff. Â That is one of their best songs. Â If we didn't have Christmas in the way, I might even be tempted to pimp my kids out and get them to do this for me. Â It's a good parental move since my whole retirement plan is for one of them to become a famous child actor who I will then shamelessly exploit into a Disney product. Â Think Hanna Montana, only for the Ottawa Valley. Â 

Anyway, back to the return of our favourite show, it's long overdue, and Nikki and I will be watching for sure.
