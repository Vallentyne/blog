As I have mentioned here many times [before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2011/07/12/camp-smitty-departure/),Â  summer camp is something that our kids have [been doing ](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2011/07/19/camp-update/)for several [years now](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2011/07/21/camp-smitty-finale/).Â  To say they love it is a complete understatement, it's so important to them now they look forward to it all year.

I saw [this article ](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/swimming-archery-at-camp-too-dangerous-for-students-school-says-1.2659573?cmp=rss)indicating that apparently the usual summer camp activities were just tooÂ risky for a school board in Toronto and they ended up cancelling a year endÂ trip on a class of grade 8 students. It's easy for me to say that they are being silly since I'm only responsible for my own kids, but I do have to say that this does kind of seem on the nutso side.Â  I mean when you see stuff like this:


<blockquote>He described Camp Walden as an exclusive facility that reduces its rates for the school to make the trip possible,Â at a cost of $150 per student.

Chiro said he was making final preparations for the June 10 trip when the school board's superintendent asked for proof that safety requirements about activities such as swimming and archery had been met.</blockquote>


This kind of thing just says to me that these kids were probably the victim ofÂ one or twoÂ squeaky wheel parents that complained about safety in theÂ dangerous wilds of "an exclusive" summer camp.Â  There might even be SPLINTERS on the docks, gasp.

I mean come on folks, ANYTHING can be dangerous if you let your imagination wander.Â  These kids live in Toronto after all, there's just so much that _could_ happen to them.Â  I mean, heaven forbid it, butÂ they might accidentally meet their Mayor, what then?Â  I'm thinking that some Hunger Games-style archery skills might give them a fighting chance, right?
