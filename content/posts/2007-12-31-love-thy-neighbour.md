A flat out brawl erupted in Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity.Â  Who was involved, you may ask.Â  Hoodlums? Nope.Â  Gang members?Â  Nah.Â  Soldiers?Â  Wrongo.Â  It was [two groups of priests](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3104350.ece) actually.

Now, I'm not an expert on religion, but I'm thinking that this is not exactly how priests should be behaving.Â  It took a dozen policemen to break up the brawl.Â  It was quite the holy racket, apparently.

I'm having a hard time picturing this going down, actually.Â  Was there two lines of priests facing off, doing the West Side Story thing, snapping their fingers?Â  Or was it an Outsiders-style gang fight?Â  Did they use those smoking yo-yos as weapons?Â  That could look pretty cool.Â  What kind of gang signs would they use? Â  Maybe they had a gang name for themselves even.Â  Maybe Heaven's Devils?Â  That has a nice ring to it.

No wonder the world is exploding with religious intolerance when priests of (almost) the same religion can't even get along.
