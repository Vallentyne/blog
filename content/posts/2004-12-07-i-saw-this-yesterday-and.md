I saw this yesterday, and Kent also emailed me about it.

I'm not what you would call a religious person, I personally think that the Darwin guys probably got it right.  So it is with amazement that I give you this: [The Creationist Museum](http://www.answersingenesis.org/museum/walkthrough/)

These guys really go for it, [here's a link](http://www.answersingenesis.org/museum/walkthrough/images/Theater-merged-copy.jpg) to one of the images from their virtual walkthrough, if you notice it has two dinosaurs being led onto Noah's ark.

There is also an article (noted by Boing Boing) that they claim the Columbine shootings were a result of the school teaching natural selection.  It's amazing, and as Kent said, maybe it's no wonder Bush got re-elected.
