Lots of places are posting about this "life imitates art" moment.  The Onion did a bit [last February](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930) about the CEO of Gillette "F#@k Everything, We're Doing Five Blades".  Now, lo and behold, [Gillette is doing just that](http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/gillette/).

It's hard to take the real announcement seriously when you have read the satire piece, which is absolutely hilarious.
