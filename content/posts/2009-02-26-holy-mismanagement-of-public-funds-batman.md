Incredibly, GM lost [another $9.6 billion dollars in the last quarter](http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090226.wgm0226/BNStory/Business/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20090226.wgm0226).Â  Apparently it also set fire to $6 billion in cash, while it was [negotiating for that $9 billion](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/12/19/finally/) in government money.

What in the heck is going on here?Â  Does this seem insane to anyone else?Â  How do you spend $6 billion in three months, while at the same time begging with your hat in hand for [$9 billion](http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081219.wbushautos1219/BNStory/Business/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081219.wbushautos1219)?Â  Thank god they kept the lights on, churning out crappy vehicles one after another.Â  They have been dealing with this for months now, and they still have only 6 vehicles out of [54 models available](http://www.gm.ca/gm/english/showrooms/cars?adv=72467) (54!) that even have hybrid as an option, and 4 of those are hybrid SUVs, like we need those somehow.Â  If this isn't just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, I don't know what it is.

Bravo, you guys are really burning up the carpet on this one.Â  I can't wait to see how this all turns out, but the sad part is the folks that will suffer because this company can't seem to pull it's head out of it's own butt.
