Taking things to a more serious level here (don't worry, the regular goofiness will resume shortly no doubt), this post from [John Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com) is just about as touching and as powerful as it gets.Â  I STRONGLY encourage you all to go and read it, then read the comments, then add your own comment to his post, then tell your own circles about it.Â  The disclaimer I can offer here is: I promise that there is no guilt-hook at the end, but you will be thinking about it for a while.
