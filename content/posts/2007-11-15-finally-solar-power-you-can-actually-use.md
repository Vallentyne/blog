A company seems to have finally cracked the solar cell production problem.Â  Solar cells have always been way too expensive to make, and so don't usually work economically as green power sources, even though there's nothing as plentiful as solar energy.Â  It's sort of a bummer.Â  Anyway, it seems that someone has figured out a way to make a [really disruptive product](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/flat/bown/2007/green/item_59.html), or so it seems to me.Â  Basically an incredibly thin, flexible solar cell, it can be rolled up, or essentially printed right onto surfaces at very low cost.Â  It's as efficient as regular solar cells (which I gather isn't very efficient at all, but probably good enough for now) but it's one-tenth of the cost to produce.Â  Now we're talking.Â  I want my roof covered with this stuff, right now.Â  I want my car painted with it.Â  What the heck, I want my balding skull covered with it so my cell phone never needs to be plugged in.Â  Don't pester me with "the facts" and questions about how my photovoltaic skull would power my cell phone, I'm all fired up with this right now.Â  Think about it, every roof top covered with solar cells because they are cheap enough to make it happen.Â  Every house is a power plant.Â  That's a pretty cool thing, if you ask me.Â  The best part might be since they are so thin, they should really take the ugly out of the equation.
