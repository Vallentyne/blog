I love [these pictures](http://www.whereiwrite.org/) of some well known science fiction writer's "offices" where they get their work done.Â  Overall, the level of clutter is stupendous. I couldn't imagine getting anything done in some of these rooms, except maybe having an anxiety attack, let alone write a book.Â  It makes me wonder how someone could focus on any one task in that kind of space.

I love the unabashed crapulence of it all.Â  Clearly some of these writers love their space.Â  These are "[man caves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_cave)" of the highest order (the ladies seem to have a much higher level of aesthetics and organization overall).Â  Wilson, you clearly need to start adopting some habits from these crazy old hermits to become a successful writer.Â  Also, sweatpants and a huge beard help with the mystique quite a bit:

Saw it on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/08/13/photos-of-science-fi.html) this morning.Â  Great stuff.

Makes me wonder why I don't have a man cave.Â  Although I don't really have anything to put in it, nor any time to be there.Â  Hm, that's probably why I don't have one.
