Nice rant, Wilson.

It gives the blog a nice sense of respectability to have an honest opinion presented here, instead of my silly stuff.

In response to your concerns, I think you can take solace in the fact that not only are most people gullible and easily led, they are also equally unlikely to actually do anything about it.  So, the net effect of the exposure to anti-environmental attitudes is basically nil.  They are not any more likely to act in an environmental way, but they also aren't very likely to go and buy a jet truck either.

Still, on a principle-of-the-matter level, I wholly agree with you.  The media should be more responsible.
