It's been a while since I did a video roundup, I suppose it must have something to do with the Youtube embargo at work....

Anyway, here are a short few, of varying quality.  First off, you have probably already seen this, but it's reasonably funny.  It's basically Will Ferrell and a foul mouthed 2 or 3 year old.   Worth a watch, but it's already been watched like a bazillion times so you have probably seen it already.  [The Landlord](http://sjl.funnyordie.com/v1/view_video.php?viewkey=3efbc24c7d2583be6925).

Then we have a Facebook infomercial that is all too true...

And finally, from Metafilter, this home movie circa 1978 of a bunch of 12 year olds making a Jaws-like movie is inspired, and genuinely good.  It's 9 minutes, but completely worth it.  These kids are good, but the home-made shark is the scene stealer.

Enjoy.
