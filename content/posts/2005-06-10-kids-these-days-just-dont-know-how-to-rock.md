Ok come on here people.  Tell me this premise for a tv show doesn't sound a little fishy:  Take Gene Simmons, the wild man from KISS, put him into an utterly straight-laced, old-fashioned private school in England.  His mission: to deliver some hard-core instruction in rock and roll to these classically trained English musicians.  Think "School of Rock" only with a washed-up old guy.

It's reality tv, I guess.  It all doesn't sound very real to me.  Apparently the students at the school don't, either.  One of them wrote a scathing article on the [school's blog](http://www.20six.co.uk/housey/nextEntries/6ltth1couqoq) about it.  He describes Gene as "burnt out" and "desperate for the limelight".

The joke of it all is, the school's name is Christ's Hospital.  Somehow.  It sounds like the name of one of KISS' albums.

Anyway, the article was picked up by the [English media](http://education.guardian.co.uk/publicschools/story/0,12505,1503827,00.html?=rss), and things should be interesting for Mr. Simmons for the next while.
