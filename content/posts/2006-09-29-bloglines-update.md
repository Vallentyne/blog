Bloglines turned on a very nice update today.  I use Bloglines every day, it's the only website I visit, almost.  The new features rock.  I just love that site.  I know I can't seem to get any of you people to try it out, but I find it a much better way to keep up with web things....  [check it out](http://www.bloglines.com).  The dynamic left panel updates make it even more specialicious.Â  The only problem I have had so far is the keyboard shortcut I use the most (I never use any of the other ones) doesn't seem to work any more:Â  "A".Â  It's still awesome tho.
I got your "bloglines freedbacking" right here....
