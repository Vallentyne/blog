It may be hard to believe, but it seems that yours truly was maybe a tad hasty to just parrot whatever I read to you, my dear readers. Â It seems that I hung the journalistic integrity hat on the peg and forgot to put it back on that day, or this year rather. Â I know how many of you rely on Vallentyne.com for your daily serving of fresh hot news, smothered in sarcasm, so it's with heavy heart that I inform you that it seems that Sarah Palin (probably) does indeed realize that Africa is a continent. Â 

Before you hang me out to dry for betraying your trust, you should probably be aware that I was not the only one to be duped. Â In fact it seems that [other small news agencies bought the story](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/arts/television/13hoax.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin).... Â MSNBC, LA Times, etc.

Too funny. Â However, the main point of [my post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/11/07/palin-behaved-like-a-hillbilly/) was about how she was a really terrible choice for VP, the extra stuff was just icing anyway.

So there you go, my bad.

You can now relax and rest assured that [Vallentyne.com](http://Vallentyne.com) remains the one and only place to go for Vallentyne-flavoured news.
