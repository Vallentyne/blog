Sent out the Evite for the 5th Annual Vallentyne Christmas party last night, so check your junk mail folders if you didn't get it.  Evite's messages are very spam-like for some systems it seems.

Here's the low-down in case you still can't find it:

December 17th, 8pm
Our Place of course
Kids, dogs are part of the scenery so feel free to bring some more.
We have:  wine, snacks, two guitars and lots of room if you want to stay
You have: anything else you want to bring to drink, and your guitar

Hope to see lots of folks there.
