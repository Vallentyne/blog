Ok, so we are finally here, T-8 hours to the Christmas Party.  If we aren't ready by now, we never will be, so why worry?

We have about 45 people confirmed that are coming, which is awesome. I'm leaving work soon, hopefully, to pick up some new music and some other last minute items. I'm going to try to make a playlist or two before tonight, and help Nikki get ready.

Remember, plan now to crash over, that way you won't argue with us so much when we talk you into it...  :-)
