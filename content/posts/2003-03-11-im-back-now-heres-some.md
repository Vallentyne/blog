I'm back.

Now here's some news.  I want to make Andrea POST today.  POST today, ok?  POST something, you know what, or Nikki and I will blow your surprise.

Now as far as the rink goes, it is simply too monumental a task, I fear that it's a wash for this year.  I'm just too lazy.  It will be back next year though, never fear.  And then Andrea won't be needing a belly helmet, she'll need a ......  Dammit!

On the personal growth front; painting sucks, but once you get going it's never as bad as it seemed.  We finished the kitchen trim this weekend.  I can hear the stunned silence now.  It's only been that way for a year now.  Well almost.  Anyway, it's a whole new colour now, that will make 4 different colours that the trim has sported since the house was built, counting the white primer.  Yikes.

It's now Onionskin Tan for the Marthas out there.  And the Smarthas.

It's brown for the guys.
