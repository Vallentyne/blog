More article regurgitation today, a bit on [how long the traces of our incredibly advanced civilization would last](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2399972.html) if we all disappeared tomorrow.Â  The short answer: not too long.Â  For the long answer click the link, or for the medium answer, [a graphic](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/TGD/picture/0,,351113,00.jpg) that displays exactly the same information as the article.Â  Interesting stuff.Â  Basically we would not even be a blip on the radar after about 50 000 years.Â  With the exception of course of Harvey's pee-burned grass art installation on my lawn.Â  There's no way that 50 000 years of wild natural reclamation is going to eradicate those things.Â  They are permanent in a way that makes the pyramids look flimsy.
