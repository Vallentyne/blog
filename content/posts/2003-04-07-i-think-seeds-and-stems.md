I think "Seeds and Stems" is a metaphor for the grassroots-type protests that that Blog is an example of....either that or it's a drug allusion. Like: "You get the most gnarly trip if you eat the seeds and stems, dude."

And I don't blame you for getting numb with all this war news (I think that might be a gov/media ploy as well; desensitize the ignorant masses with trite footage of distant, non-invasive, and rather pretty "fourth-of-July-like" explosions in Baghdad). I, for some reason, can't stop reading all the "alt" news even though it just makes me very angry. Perhaps that's a good thing, though.
