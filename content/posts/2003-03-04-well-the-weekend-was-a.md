Well.

The weekend was a big hit, Nikki and I had a great time in Kingston, lots of food and drink and fun.  The kids had fun too at Nanny and Poppy's, despite the pox.  And Harvey was just glad to be home and not in the car.  Pretty good overall, for me.  For Nikki not so good, I proved that I can out-drink her by a wide margin.  Her absence on this web page will prove her agreement to this statement....  Done!

On the "just got a clue" front Nikki and I finally got around to renting "Signs" on Friday.  Kent was over and watched it with us, or really he made us rent it.  It was excellent, and though we are rather late to the party on that particular movie I highly recommend it to anyone.  Just the right amount of scary.  Why is Mel Gibson believable as a reverend?  He shouldn't be, right?  I mean he is Mad Max.  Anyway, it's very good.

It's March now.  Winter is over.  Please shut off the snow and turn on the heat, thank you.

Still no pictures Andrea.  Sorry.  It might be faster if we just bring them up with us eh?  :-)

later.
