Ok, here is the most fun resume I have ever seen in my life.  Yes, resume.  [Check this guy out](http://213.186.36.10/%7Eal/alstudio/cv/en.htm) right now, I really mean it.  It's obvious that English is his second language, which makes me give him all the more credit for doing this.  The part that made me laugh the hardest was the spoken musical break at the very end, he really gets into it.  Be sure to listen to the end.

This guy is going to be hired immediately, he is obviously very talented, but the best thing about it is making himself noticed in a tall stack of resumes.  Wow.
