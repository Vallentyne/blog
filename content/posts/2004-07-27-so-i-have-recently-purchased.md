So, I have recently purchased something on the web I'm a little excited about, and the website provides you with the Fedex tracking number.  If you have never seen this before, it lets you see where your shipment is in excrutiating detail on the Fedex website.  Here's an excerpt from the status window on my shipment.

July 26, 2004
1:22 pm - Left FedEx Origin Location SHANGHAI CN (that's China, not Shanghai, Connecticut like I thought at first glance)
3:09 pm - Arrived at Sort Facility ANCHORAGE AK
6:23 pm - Left FedEx Sort Facility ANCHORAGE AK
2:31 am - Left FedEx Sort Facility MEMPHIS TN

Jul 27, 2004
7:01 am - Arrived at FedEx Ramp WINNIPEG CA
7:01 am - Left FedEx Ramp WINNIPEG CA

That's some impressive reporting right there.  It's all very exciting.  The package is in the country, the eagle has landed.  I think I will keep obsessively checking the website over and over again, refreshing the page repeatedly until the network guys come and ask me nicely to stop doing that since I'm taking all of the available Internet bandwidth.  Yeah, that's what I'll do.  I have also turned up the detail on the tracking website, let's see what happens now.

I'll keep you posted.
