Here's a [news article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=458282&in_page_id=1811&ico=Homepage&icl=TabModule&icc=picbox&ct=5) about the pictures I posted [a while back](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/05/15/underwater-tigers/).  This is simply the coolest thing I can remember seeing, I love this guy.  His snarly, wrinkly face is terrifyingly cute.
