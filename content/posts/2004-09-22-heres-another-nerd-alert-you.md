Here's another nerd alert.

You may have used [mapquest.com](http://www.mapquest.com) in the past.  It's very informative I will admit.  But I bet you didn't know (I know I didn't) about these other sites.  Try [Mappoint](http://mappoint.msn.com) out for larger, clearer maps.  That's not too bad, but the real thing is [Map24.](http://www.us.map24.com/)  Oh baby, zooming maps are where it's at.  That is so cool.  I got wind of these from the [Scobleizer ](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/20.html#a8272)blog, but I just had to post them because I'm shameless.
