Ok, let me start with a little background.Â  On the weekend we noticed that Harvey's ear felt a little strange.Â  There was a puffy bubble inside the skin of his ear.Â  We were concerned of course, so Nikki made an appointment at the vet for Monday.Â  Nikki is also really sick, and she and Cael had to take Harv all the way to Pakenham.Â  Turns out he had a broken blood vessel in there, causing the bubble (hm, I [wonder how that happened](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/category/llife-with-lloyd)?)Â  They drained it and wrapped it and off they all went.Â  Harvey had to have his ear bandaged flat to his head so that it would heal properly, so they wrapped bandages all around his head, which made him look absolutely ridiculous, by the way.Â  Well it seems that the vet accidentally wrapped him too tightly because on the way home he started to choke and gasp.Â  Nikki removed the bandages and turned right around and drove back to the vet.Â  Finally we get Harv home last night, Nikki goes to bed early to rest while I clean up and get the kids to bed.Â  Anyway when I finally had time to take Harv for a pee I noticed he was panting and gasping, ever so slightly.Â  Now, let's be clear here that Harvey is a bit of a drama queen, and in hindsight he was probably playing up the sympathy a bit.Â  Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea to rewrap his head, slightly looser to make him more comfortable.Â  As it turns out that was a bad idea.Â  By the time he woke up in the morning his ear had come loose in the bandages, and was puffy again.Â  Now Nikki is feeling even worse with her cold, wants to just die in bed and instead has to take him back to the vet yet again, probably pay for the procedure again, and make Cael late for school again.

It seems that my computer job doesn't translate well to veterinary medicine.Â  Duly noted.Â  Also, there will be no further sympathy for dogly discomfort.Â  These two new tactics should do wonders for my marriage, my wallet, my child's education, and Nikki's health.
