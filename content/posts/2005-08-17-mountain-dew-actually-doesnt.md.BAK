Am I the only person left that didn't know that [Mountain Dew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew) sold in Canada has no caffeine?  I may be a little late to the clue party on this one, but am I alone?

I had no idea.  In the US, it has caffeine, and a lot of it, which is probably why I'm out to lunch.  Anybody with me out here in cluelesstown?
