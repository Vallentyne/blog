I am way late to the [Dropkick Murphys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropkick_Murphys) party, I basically just discovered them to my great dismay.Â  I have been experiencingÂ Celtic music fatigue of late, having absolutely listened to death all of the Great Big Sea, Pogues, Stan Rogers, etc, that I could take over the past 10 years or more.Â  But to call these guys just Celtic is not correct, they are almost more of a Punk band than anything, at least on their latest album, Signed and Sealed in Blood.Â  I highly recommend you check them out.

The standout song that made me laugh right out loud today is ironically a Christmas song that was released last month, but I missed it altogether.Â  It's absolutely a spiritual successor to the Pogues' Fairytale of New York, and it's just hilarious.Â  Here's just one lyric to listen for in the video below:


<blockquote>My sisters are wackjobs I wish I had none

Their husbands are losers and so are their sons

My nephew's a horrible wise little twit

He once gave me a nice gift wrapped box full of shit</blockquote>


Oh man, it's the real deal.Â  Have a look at the completely awesome video and enjoy.Â  Go out and buy this album, these guys deserve your money.
