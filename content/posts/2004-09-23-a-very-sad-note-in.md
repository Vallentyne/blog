A very sad note in business today, [from Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/23/rip_twinkies_wonder_.html), Interstate Bakeries filed for bankruptcy. Why would you give a Ding Dong about that? Well, let me fill you in with delicious details. They make everything that is synonymous with fatty goodness.  Twinkies, Ring Dings (what the heck are those?), Ho Hos, Wonder Bread, all dead.  It's a terrible day for snacking.

What will we do now?
