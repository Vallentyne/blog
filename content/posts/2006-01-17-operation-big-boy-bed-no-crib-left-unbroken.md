Cael turned 2 last week, as I mentioned [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/caels_birthday.html).  His gradual growth has been documented rather [extensively ](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/08/so_a_long_weeke.html)on this site already.

However he is also becoming a grown up little guy in other ways.  Notably his sleeping arrangements.  If you recall it wasn't long ago that he, ah, [exceeded the design limits](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/timing_is_every.html) of his crib.  That forced us to put him in his playpen to sleep, which [has happened before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/02/well_that_was_p.html) with Quinn if you recall.

So, over the last few days we have had containment problems with the playpen solution, and so we have gone to "Sleep Code Red" in his room.  That's most accurately described by my lovely wife:



<blockquote>.... Little "Hulk" busted up his crib months ago, as you know, and can get out of his playpen now.  This only provides the prime opportunity to jump on his bed and smash his face in one, not-so-smooth, uncalculated and unpredictable maneuver (while mom runs ... in what seems like slow-mo, shouting a muffled and distorted "NOOOOOOOOO!") - great!  So, we stripped his room of everything (except a playpen and a queen sized mattress, no frame, on the floor), have hook & eye locks on his closet and bedroom door and... Bob's your uncle.

Aside from running at high speeds straight into the wall on purpose, or role-playing the high-wire act on the side of his playpen, well I'd say we're good for a few months at this pace.  Whaddayagonnado?</blockquote>



So, wish us luck.  It's one more step on the long road.

Aside:  In researching this post I came across [this post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/02/well_the_skatin.html) from the archives, which I find eerily true, and it's a different kid this time.  Wow.  I should write some more "Vallentyne Parenting Theorems" down.  They could be useful later to someone.
