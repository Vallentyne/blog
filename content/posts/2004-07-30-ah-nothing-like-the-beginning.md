Ah, nothing like the beginning of August in Canada.  Today at work I have received no less than 15 email messages announcing the beginning of someone's holidays.  The government should just declare the whole month to be a national holiday, it would make things a lot easier.




I'm not taking any holidays of course, but it will effectively force me to not get anything done while all of these people are away.




Oh well.  Betcha Nikki wishes she could declare holidays from her job some days....
