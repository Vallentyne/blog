Y'know, sometimes you just have to stand back and take a look at some of the things you've done in your life, and most importantly, some of the things you've done to others.  I just had one of these reflective moments this morning and thought I might share with everyone to allow you fine people to learn from my mistakes.

Just this morning I was on the blog here, and saw the random pictures that creep up on the side there.  Ah, so nice.  As I was enjoying these pictures, I noticed one that hit me like an unsuspecting spring-loaded mallet to the face (a la Bugs Bunny, Warner Bros. style).  Here's the picture of which I speak below.  See if you can spot the grave overly-protective motherly error made here.  Take a second.  In fact take all the time you need.  I'm sure the average person would spot it in about .000001 of a millisecond.

Honestly.  This just goes to show what type of patient and tolerant person Jordy is.  Despite the ridiculous hat that her mother has forced her to wear IN A HOT TUB, she still appears to be having a great time.  A big thanks to Ali and Jim for humouring me on such an erroneous parental move.

I'd like to chalk it up to being (at the time) a hot tub virgin, but really... I think that's a bit weak.
