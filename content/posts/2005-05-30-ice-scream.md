So, you may have seen it a hundred times already today, but here's the obligatory post about [The Brainfreeze.com](http://thebrainfreeze.com/).  While the video is pretty amusing, what I can't help but wonder is what the people in the video were thinking when asked specifically to give themselves this extremely painful condition on purpose.  It sort of defies logic.  I should get ahead of this curve and register www.croquetmalletinthepills.com and get my own video of people started.  Given what I've seen it should be hugely popular.

If there's a better use for the Internet... I don't know what it is.
