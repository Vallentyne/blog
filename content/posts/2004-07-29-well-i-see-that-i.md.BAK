Well I see that I have touched [a bit of a nerve ](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/07/ok-enough-about-my-recent-fedex.htm#comments)with the printer ink thing.  I really don't know where the ink comes from, but if Kyle is right and they actually milk squids to get it, how does that explain the colour ink?  Those poor squids, I don't even want to think about it.  But it sounds like they at least will have the funds to get excellent medical attention if necessary.

And Ali, I'm not one to judge anyone, but if we think back to your somewhat recent ride on a startup company up and then down into the dirt, maybe your office printing policy could be somewhat to blame?  Like incurring excessive office printing costs that cut into profits, stock value slippage, and eventually trigger the mass letting go of all employees?

It's just something to think about...
