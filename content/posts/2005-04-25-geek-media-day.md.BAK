So, here's a few links about geeky stuff.  It's not the normal stuff I must say, and the second one is especially humourous.

First off, I have to ask you if you remember School House Rock.  You know, those incredibly cheesy cartoons they used to play on Saturday mornings in between G-Force and Rocket Robin Hood?  It featured bad animation and terrible songs, but the one I remember best was about a how a bill becomes a law.  Anyway, if you don't remember by now you never saw it.  So, with that firmly in mind I give you this: [Hitachi's new hard drive technology](http://hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html).  

Oh man, this is bang on, and I'm fascinated by it, somehow.

And then, we have none other than John Cleese [shlepping himself in classic manner](http://www.backuptrauma.com/video/default2.aspx) for a hard-disk based backup company.  The main video is pretty funny, honestly.  It's not much of an ad, but it must have cost quite a bit to produce.

So, there you have it, Geek Media day.
