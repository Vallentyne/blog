I had an important phone call this morning at home, one that I was a little worked up for beforehand. Â I was tired of reviewing what I thought was important to the call, I probably wasn't going to make myself any smarter in the last 10 minutes before the call.

Instead, I watched this:

This girl's laugh is incredibly infectious, it's a goofy silly thing that completely relaxed me for my call. Â It was perfect, and the call went very well. Â This video is of course a meme now, and remixes abound. Â The simplest of which is some camera trickery to remove the special effects from the video and see her just laughing into the camera, which of course isn't nearly as funny.

Thank you, strange laughing girl. Â That was a very important call.
