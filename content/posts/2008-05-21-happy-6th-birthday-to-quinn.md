The coolest cowpoke in town turns 6 today.Â  Happy Birthday Quinn, you definitely are one tough hombre.

One of Quinn's birthday wishes was to get his own copy of The Hobbit, which I have been reading to the boys at bedtime.Â  Since I'm pretty sure he doesn't read the blog just yet, I can safely say he will be getting a copy without his finding out....

Happy Birthday Dude.
