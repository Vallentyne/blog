First off, I'd like to say, "Thanks Honey!" to Court for my birthday blog.  You my love, are as always... too sweet.  I love you too, completely.

As for the rest of you who may drop in here on the blog, let me just say a blanket and heartfelt "THANK YOU" to everyone who remembered, called, and spoiled me rotten.  I've felt very loved since Friday of last week.  

Just when you start to think that another birthday doesn't matter, you find yourself surrounded by friends and family who make you realize that, yeah, it kinda does, and isn't it great really?  I don't feel a day older and it is all of you that i have to thank for it.

Hugs and kisses to all,
Nik

PS - Also, I'd like to just make public here that Robbi Wilson got away unscathed from tiaras, leas, wands and silly string on this particular birthday.  Enjoy it Wilson, your day will come where the tables will be turned and I will sit and laugh in the shadows whilst you shine in the limelight.  Happy birthday though!  It's always a riot sharing a birthday with you...especially when Lockrey gets in on the scene!  I'm sure pictures will follow... including the ones where I kick some royal Wilson butt ;-)
