You gotta love the [balls](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/05/02/colberts-got-them-big-ones-too/) it takes to make fun of every politician in the US in one fell swoop.  Stephen Colbert [announced](http://www.indecision2008.com/blog.jhtml?c=ts&loc=tagCloud&searchType=tag&term=blog_tag_the_colbert_report) that he is [running for President](http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003657754), as a candidate for [both parties](http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2007/10/17/4582073-ap.html).  I have no idea what this means, but I expect a lot of internet, nerd, geek, and apathetic votes to go his way.  It will probably be a brilliant send-up of the whole process at the very least.

Saw this on [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/65621/Stephen-Colbert-is-running-for-president-in-South-Carolina) first.
