Lots and lots of things happened since I last posted, the most important was finding out that cousin Angie and other friends we know of are safe and sound after Sunday's earthquake.  While I was in my warm holiday cocoon and taking a TV and internet break (and therefore ignorant of world events) truly awful things were happening to people, it's seems wrong to think of our safe little world here.   Words don't convey it really, but I'm a lucky man.
