For most folks living in the Ottawa area for their entire lives (like me) the idea of a really big tornado is certainly scary, but comfortably vague.Â  I saw Twister, neat movie.Â  But there's no way a movie could prepare you for something like [this](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/05/07/severe.weather/index.html).Â  The town of Greensburg Kansas is [gone](http://www.kansas.com/static/slides/050507tornadoaerials/).

That's just incredible.Â  Maybe the most amazing part is that so far only 9 people are reported dead out of a town of 1500.Â  The tornado that hit it was a mile-wide and awfully angry.

Amazing, and sad.
