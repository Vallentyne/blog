I know that writing a review of an almost 20 year old album is not exactly riveting reading for you folks, but, too bad.  On top of that, it's a celtic album.  I was really falling out of love with the Celtic stuff in the past few years.  Not that I hated it or anything, but I was just basically sick of what I had, I guess.  I listened to a lot of Great Big Sea (in fact Nik and I just saw them at the beginning of the month, and they were great) and that's about it.  I like them still, and they are an excellent live show, but I just never put their stuff on at home given a choice.  Anyway, that's a looong intro to tell you that you must go and buy this album:  [The Pogues](http://www.pogues.com/) - If I Should Fall From Grace With God.

It's a good mix of fun celtic traditional songs and originals played with an energy and style that makes them incredibly appealing.  This is the first Pogues album I have ever purchased, and have only really ever heard a couple of songs before (Dirty Old Town, and Fairytale of New York which is also on this album).  They are very very good, you can't deny the excellent sound they have, it's unique and original.  Or it was 20 years ago, I have heard a few imitators since this was made and they don't quite get it right.  Anyway, excellent stuff, you should buy it and have a listen, I swear I can actually smell beer and smoke (in a good "pub memory" kind of way) when I listen to "South Australia" in particular.
