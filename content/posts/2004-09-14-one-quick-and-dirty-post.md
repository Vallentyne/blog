One quick (and dirty) post before I leave for the day.

The other night Quinn was in the bathtub.  He was sitting quietly, with a distant, disturbed look on his face.  I was watching him and he was doing something behind his back, I asked him what he was doing.  He said "There a hole in there!"

...and that my friends is a fundamental life discovery, as witnessed by his father.  I'll always remember the day Quinn discovered his butt.  And me without my camera.
