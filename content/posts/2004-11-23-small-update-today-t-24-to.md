Small update today.

T-24 to the 4th Annual Vallentyne Christmas Party.  December 17th, chez Vallentyne's.  Yes, that's a lot of notice, but it's Christmas.  Don't be caught with something else to do, or you're dead.

Feral baby is now Civilized Baby.  Almost.  Cael [got a haircut](http://www.vallentyne.com/family/caels%20new%20do.jpg) and is looking almost respectable.

Nana J and I took the lads to the Kanata Scouts and Brownies Parade on the weekend and froze ourselves.  I guess they technically call it the Santa Claus parade, but really it was more of a showcase of just how many Beavers, Boy Scouts, Junior Campers, Girl Guides, Brownies, Little Communists, Pathfinders, Little Geeks, Junior Janitors and the like there are in Kanata.

Anyway, that's all for now.
