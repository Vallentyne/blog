Nikki discovered that you can sign up to be alerted when the Ottawa Police release a news bulletin on their website.Â  It's a really good idea, but it could be slightly better if they used RSS feeds.Â  That's just the nerd in me though.Â 

Still, it's kind of nice to hear about what's going on in the city, since I don't ever get to read the local paper.Â  I did find some of the alerts rather amusing since they will update older alerts with breaking news sometimes.Â  For instance they were looking for a man and a woman who robbed a store.Â  They described the man as in hisÂ 30's and the woman as being in her 20's.Â  When they caught the pair and identified them the man was 53 and the woman was 42. Whatever these two are doing, they must look pretty good.Â  The criminal life suits them, you could say.Â  Maybe they are fitness freaks and they were robbing a nutritional supplement store?

Â Still probably not a wise career choice....

Â Go sign up for the alerts yourself [here](http://www.ottawapolice.ca/en/serving_ottawa/media_room/subscription_centre.cfm)Â and get your own fresh dose of stupid human behaviour.
