Overheard last night while the boys were getting a haircut.Â  Nikki took the lads to Goobers, but it was too busy, so they went to First Choice instead.Â  Quinn wasn't too keen on getting his mop of hair handled.

Quinn: First Choice?Â  More like second choice...

Nikki: Oh yeah?Â  More like No Choice, buddy.

Har har.Â  The family is much like living with a bunch of comedians....Â  For the record, Cael got the "[Bieber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber)".Â  Also, this whole story is Nikki's, not mine.
