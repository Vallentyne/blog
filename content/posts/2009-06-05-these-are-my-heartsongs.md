Sometimes I get the urge to share my taste in music with others, itâ€™s uncontrollable and it usually happens when I happen onto a particularly excellent song on the iPod as I work away at my desk.Â  The best moments are when the song gives me goosebumps, a rush of emotion, and a sense of the impossible awesomeness of the song.Â  The drive to immediately tell someone about it, and let someone else either agree completely with me, or realize that yes, I am in fact a musical genius and yes my taste is impeccable and compelling.

Before you start on me, I know Iâ€™m not a genius, and I also know that for most, artists like Bob Dylan (heard [House Carpenter](http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/house-carpenter) today, had a religious experience, and then wrote this post) and [John Prine](http://www.johnprine.net/) arenâ€™t going to appear on any â€œFive Starâ€ iTunes playlists like they do for me.Â  Thereâ€™s just no arguing with that feeling, though, so sometimes I attack Nikki with this stuff.Â  Sheâ€™s very patient with me, and seems to even enjoy some of the stuff I make her listen to.Â  Sometimes itâ€™s too much even for her though, like if I push a particularly twangy or bluegrassy [Steve Earle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Earle) song.

Even though I have been listening to that same stuff for literally more than a decade now, that doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t happen with newer stuff.Â  For instance I recently have become addicted to Weezer (the post title is a nod to a Weezer song) like it is crack.Â  You just canâ€™t find better crafted, hookier pop rock these days.Â  Itâ€™s clever and sometimes funny, itâ€™s not all the same, and it will grab you by the ears and make you listen over and over.Â  On the less rocky side of things, thereâ€™s Moonlight Graham ([the guy](http://grahamgreer.com/) from Barstool Prophets) which is excellent, thoughtful and his voice is a pleasure to listen to.Â  Then all the way to gravel road, whisky bottle, dusty pickup folk-country is Fred Eaglesmith (thanks Shawn), who writes and sings as raw as it gets.

I could go on, but thereâ€™s only so much music you can really process to this extent.Â  I mean sure I listen to the radio, but most of those songs come and go without really staying with you.Â  Quality is hard to come by it seems.

Are there any songs like that for you, or is it just me?
