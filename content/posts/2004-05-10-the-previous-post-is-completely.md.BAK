The previous post is completely work-related, btw.  Just wanted to make sure nobody mis-interpreted that one.

So, on the work related front, let me ask you this.  When there is a security guard at the front door, and the employees are issued picture ID badges, one would reasonably expect that the security guards would actually check to make sure the pictures on the ID match the faces of the people presenting them.

I understand that there is a certain familiarity that is a necessity here, but still the fact of the matter is I could have been fired yesterday, how does the guard know that if I stick a vaguely similar card in a plastic sleeve and flash it at him from 8 feet away?

But my favourite is the sleeping security guard.  I'm serious.  There's a guard where I work that is in his early fifties, he wears slightly tinted glasses, and he's convinced himself that nobody can tell he's sleeping behind these things.  He sits upright, facing the flow of people, but his eyes ARE CLOSED.  I of course play my role in the charade and dutifully hold up my lunchkit and keep on walking.  Or I hold up my empty hand if someone else is in the lobby.  I wouldn't want to embarass him after all.

I mean come on people.  He's a SECURITY GUARD.  All his job requires him to do is just stay awake, and he's not able to do even that.  Go to bed at a reasonable time for cryin' out loud.  It's not like we're talking about the night shift, that can be forgiven of course.  It's 1:30pm and this guy is snoozing.  Is it too much to ask?

sigh.
