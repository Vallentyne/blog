On the family front things have been fairly quiet.

Cael had a doctor's appointment yesterday and got weighed. Not in the "judged" sense but rather for body mass. He's a svelte 27 lbs now, and apparently can just about look down and see the top of the normal curve from where he is, so the doctor is happier with him now. That doesn't help Nikki much when she has to carry him around from day to day, but hey. When life gives you lemons, whip them at somebody's head. It makes you feel better.

Quinn [if you recall](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/02/well-that-was-painful.htm) was resisting Operation Big Boy Bed. Well, we tried it again a week ago or so and had complete success. He loves it, and we pretend to not notice that he jumps on it.  It was a non-event this time around, go figure.

Jordy is getting ready for Grade 4, unbelievably.  She is really growing up.  I think that maybe Jordy and Nikki both are ready for school to start this year... but maybe you should ask Nikki.  :-)  Jordy will also be starting karate again, only this time with our good neighbour Jason doing some of the teaching.  I know Jordy is excited about that.
