Yep, Wilson definitely came back with guns blazing after the first day, so I guess we can't bug him too badly.  As for the biking in general, I would much rather be on a bike than be running on my feet....  Gibson you're nuts.  How exactly does one measure body fat, anyway?

By the way, Nikki and I finally caught up this weekend with TPB and I must say that there have been some hilarious episodes recently.  The standout line in my memory (after only one viewing of each, mind) is Lahey's "Nice Sh*t analogy, Rick".  Man, those guys are good.  And how about some kudos for Alex Lifeson for not doing a walk on guest shot, instead actually having a role on Sunday's show?  That guy is a good sport.  Ricky even knocked him down with his hands and feet tied up with duct tape.  That's sort of above and beyond for a guest, especially not an actor at all.  And he also admitted to smoking dope on the show.  Jeez.
