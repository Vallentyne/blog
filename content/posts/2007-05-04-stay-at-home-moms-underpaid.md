From the department of the obvious:Â  [Stay at Home Moms work hard and get paid nothing](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/05/02/mothers.worth/index.html?eref=rss_topstories).Â  Well duh.

The article says that Moms work the equivalent of 10 jobs and of course get paid for none of them.Â  I think Nikki would heartily agree.
