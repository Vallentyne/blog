Quinn cut his top, front, left tooth yesterday and we can see the front right one coming in beside it just under the gum.  The little guy is awake now so that concludes my little update session.  Well that was short and sweet.  More later I would imagine.  Oh ya, btw, I still don't imagine I will get a word in edgewise much.  Time will tell though.
