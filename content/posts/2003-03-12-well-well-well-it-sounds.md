Well! Well! Well!  It sounds like someone (Nikki?) did blow my news by Cindy's post.  Sorry Courtney for not posting quick enough.  I'm just still adjusting to the news myself.

WE'RE HAVING TWINS!

It's a blessing and wonderful news but as you can all imagine not something I could have EVER imagined.  The twins are fraternal so biologically a major miracle - we never knew how fertile we were!  Geez.  John is adjusting the budget and wondering where we're going to fit everything and I imagine his 2-door Cavalier will very soon be upgraded  a family vehicle.  I'm just trying to not get upset about the increased weight gain but whenever I do have a moment like that I think about the 2 people we've made and are bringing into the world to love.  It's going to be great!

I am always at work these days so I must sign off but thanks to everyone for their encouraging words and double congratulations!
