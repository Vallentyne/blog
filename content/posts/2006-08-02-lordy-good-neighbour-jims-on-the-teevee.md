I spoke about GNJ [last month](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/06/good_neighbour.html) when he was participating in the (debilitating and brutal) [Primal Quest](http://www.ecoprimalquest.com/) race.  Well, it turns out the folks at the Weather Network liked the cut of Jim's jib (I can't imagine why, but I guess his jib can't be all bad; Ali did get hitched with the guy) and thought they should be asking him and the team [some questions](http://www.weather.com/multimedia/videoplayer.html?clip=3765%26collection=roadcrew%26from=vid_brws2%26tab=3%26nav=54).

Very cool stuff, congrats to Jim and thanks for leaving the helmet on, since after racing in that heat, I'm thinking the hairdo is probably one of the first things to go.
