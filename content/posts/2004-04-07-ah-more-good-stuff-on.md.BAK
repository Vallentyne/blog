Ah, more good stuff on the online music thing.

Apparently the rocket scientists in the music industry are [preparing to "adjust" the prices of online CDs](http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/0407downloading07-ON.html) and singles.  The basic gist is that a CD download will cost more than the physical CD from a store.

.

That's stunned silence, in case you can't tell.  What the heck are these people thinking?  Where does this make sense?  One example qutoed in the article is almost $4 more if you download it.  Sure, sign me up.  Let me pay **more** for it, **not** get any artwork or media, have it polluted with digital copyright protection so that I **can't** play it anywhere I want, and so I will have to burn it to a CD anyway (that I have to buy myself anyway, and [pay an extra tax on](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,57114,00.html)).  Yep.  That's good business right there.  Them fellers are smmart.

oh, yeah, maybe jacking the price of a whole album is stupid, so maybe let's force people to buy a bad song when they buy a good song.  I wish I was joking, read the article.

man.
