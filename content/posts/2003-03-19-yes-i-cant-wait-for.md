Yes, I can't wait for double-trouble everything!  Chicken pox for two at the same time will be SO much fun.  Thanks Court - I was just getting used to the idea of twins and trying to think of all the good things...each one leading by example for the other, having a best friend forever - now it's gone - NICE!  I know we're in for it but there's no turning back now.  My cousin Rob wanted to know what John was asking for his hockey equipment and golf clubs.  I think John's going to have an auction and put the money toward a god-awful minivan!  UGH!

Ciao,
the ever-growing Andrea
