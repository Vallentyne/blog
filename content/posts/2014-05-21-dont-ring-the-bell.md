I saw this on Facebook today, and watched it and immediately felt all kinds of inspired.Â  This is old school, highly potent, and hard core motivation right here.Â  It's a fascinating insight into Seal training, but mostly makes you feel about 10 feet tall and bulletproof for any of the hard stuff in your life.Â  I'm TOTALLY going to make the kids watch this because it's a Dad thing.Â  I mean, come on, there's a really sly parenting angle built right into this awesome speech, and you will see what I mean.Â  And when a four star general tells you to make your bed, well that's probably good advice.

Joking aside, this is a fantastic speech about what it means to persevere and succeed.Â  It's a long one, but it's well worth it.
