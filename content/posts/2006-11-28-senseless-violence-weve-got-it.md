If you need another couple of reasons to be glad to live in Canada ([although it's not quite the Canada it used to be](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2006/11/22/2446825-cp.html), it's still Canada for now) I would be happy to oblige with a few links this afternoon.

First off, [a story from Texas](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/28/now_wash_your_hands/) about someone who takes bathroom cleanliness very very seriously.  It seems that someone noticed a non-washer (you know the kind I'm talking about, and you know who you are) and waited for them outside in the parking lot in order to stab them multiple times.  I can sympathize a little bit with the stabber here since I'm a washer, but I would just sort of stop at not shaking their hands.  The stabbing thing really goes a tad too far.

Then we come to craziness around buying a PS3, apparently some guys thought it would be a great idea to [mug the first few nerds in line](http://news.com.com/2061-10786_3-6138896.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1_3-0-20&subj=news) to buy a PS3 in Connecticut.  Not a bad plan, but one of the first few guys in line wouldn't give them anything and so they ran off after laying a beating on him, and one of the muggers turned a fired a shot at the guy, hitting him in the chest.  The quote nicely sums up what happened next:

"For some reason I wasn't thinking about my wound, I was all about those PlayStations."</blockquote>

Ah, now that makes perfect sense to me.  What a moron.

And finally, [a wonderful graphic](http://www.nsc.org/lrs/statinfo/odds_dying.jpg) from the US National Safety Council that displays the odds of dying from a number of causes, and clearly from what I can see, neitherÂ  non-washing or buying a video game system is on this list, so I think these guys will be ok from now on.
