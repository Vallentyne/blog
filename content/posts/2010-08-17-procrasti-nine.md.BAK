I can take delaying work to new heights. Â I have done it today, in spades. Â I know I'm doing it, there's no fooling myself. Â I have to read about 450 pages of really boring technical material. Â I gave myself a deadline to get it all done, there should have been lots of time to do it. Â It's still not done, my deadline is down to about 5 hours of remaining time. Â This morning I have wasted about 2 hours of reading time doing the following:



	  * Tidy the kitchen and house so the cleaning lady could come in and do a good job.
	  * File some papers
	  * Clean off my desk
	  * Facebook check
	  * Carefully select some reading music in iTunes
	  * Chat with Nikki who was stuck in an enormous traffic jam
	  * Scratch four dog ears and two dog bellies
	  * Tidy up some dangling cables in the office
	  * Send four emails
	  * Write this damn blog post

My book remains open beside me as I type this. Â Oh, page 298 why do you look like a huge boulder? Â There's no reason why it's so hard to read this crap, besides the fact that it's boring, and I know most of it. Â Ok, so there are two fairly big reasons.

Alright, that's it, square the shoulders and just grab page 298 by the horns. Â It's on, Mother-booker!

Wait, what's that shiny thing over there on the web? Â Oh, it's a cute video of an otter.... Â awww.

What the? Â CRAP.
