Hi kids.

Little news beyond boring details as usual, but one good thing is the rink is nearing completion.  Due in no small part to Good Neighbour Jim's hard work, the Nairn St. Arena is opening on Sunday.

This year's rink is quite a bit bigger than last year's, it's now 80 x 40 feet.  That's about 20 feet longer and 13 feet wider than last year.  That's a big surface let me tell ya.  I'm not looking forward to the water bill next month, let's say.  It is approaching perfection at the moment, just a few stubborn spots to iron out before Sunday's festivities.  A good skate with a few people always knocks down the rough patches anyway, so that should be just fine.  I will try to get some rink construction photos posted so you can appreciate just how much freaking work Jim did.

Btw, if you are interested in taking part in a skate on Sunday afternoon, the shinny is scheduled to start at 2pm, kids and grownups are welcome.  Bring your hockey sticks and jerseys if you have them.

See ya.
