Hey people,

Yeah, the periodic post, after promising I'd be here more often.  Whadda-ya-gunna-do?  Well summer is here for the most part.  That will mean that with the kids home all day everyday, my posts will be even less frequent.

Jordynn's last day of school will be on the 24th.  Quinn's will be on the 25th and Cael's last day EVER of preschool will be tomorrow.  Littlest man of the house graduates from preschool and prepares to join Quinn at the elementary school in September.  He's looking forward to that as it means a bus ride to school instead of "Mom's Taxi Service".  I think "Mom's Taxi Service" (MTS) provides better service but who can really compete with a 4 year olds lust to ride the muggy, metal, yellow tube?

This graduation (of sorts) will be bittersweet for him I imagine seeing as the two loves of his life are not joining him at the same school next year.  Me being a dogan means we have the kids in the Catholic system.  His girlfriends won't be at the same school.  I'm not sure if he's figured this out yet or not.  Good thing their mom and I have become friends, that way he gets to see them regularly (hopefully!) without having to depend on school.

A little conversation I heard in the back row of the van a week or so ago went something like this:

Q-"Cael, why do your girlfriends always want to play with you?"

C-"Well Quinn, (snicker snicker) they think I can save the world."

[insert them both having a good yuk over this and through giggling chatter they say]

Q-"But Cael...You CAN'T save the WORLD!!!"  (snicker snicker)

C-"YEAH!  I KNOW!"  (Laugh laugh snicker snicker)

I know for a fact that these girls are smarter than these two chuckleheads give them credit for.  This could mean that these girls are well on their way to understanding what it means to feed a man's ego.  God love them!

More later!
