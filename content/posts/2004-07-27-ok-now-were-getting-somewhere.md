Ok, now we're getting somewhere, but it's still not enough.

11:18 am - Package status WINNIPEG CA Package available for clearance
11:24 am - Package status WINNIPEG CA Released for Delivery

I'm waiting to see updates like:

11:19am - Package carried down hall from loading dock.
11:20am - Package set down on that table near the lunchroom where Carl eats his egg salad.
11:21am - Package nudged slightly by Carl's elbow.
11:21am - New address sticker affixed to package cause Carl smeared egg salad on the old one.

I mean come on, I'm going to need a lot more useless data to obsess over here, people!
