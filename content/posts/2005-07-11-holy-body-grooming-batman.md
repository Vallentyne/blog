What the hell, how old am I?  [Here is a link](http://bodygroom.philips.com/) to a truly bizarre shaving product from Philips, with an absolutely disturbing opening flash.  I'm sure some marketing dude would look very sympathetic and tell me I'm not in "the target demographic" for this product, but come on here people, how many guys actually shave their fuzzy buddies?  That's what they suggest, not just suggest, they outright state that's what they expect you to do with this thing.


<blockquote>Trimming back pubic hair is thought to add an extra "optical inch" to your manhood (which probably explains why nearly half of all British men have had a go at trimming theirs).</blockquote>


Wow, that's quite the shot across the bow of the British men, isn't it?  It sort of implies they might need that "optical inch", doesn't it?  But they did answer my question of how many guys do this, if I can believe their stats.  They wouldn't print a bald-faced lie, would they?

I really can't stomach the shaved kiwi images though, that's just got to go.  It strikes a little too close to home.  I will say that after having had some minor surgery a little while ago, the dry safety razor provided for just this purpose by the doctor did a bang up job of the lads.  But we aren't talking completely smooth here, more like a landing strip.  I just can't see voluntarily taking an electric weed wacker to the pink parts and talking yourself into thinking that's a good idea, no matter what you think girls like.

Am I an old fogey here?  I would welcome some feedback.
