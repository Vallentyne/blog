Yet another whirlwind post when I really should be thinking about getting on the bus.  Work is too busy, or I am too slow, one thing or the other.  Nikki is a patient woman, that much is sure.




Now that we have that awful spring forward crap out of the way, and I am ever so slowly clawing my way back to a normal sleep rhythm, here's a couple of alarm clock innovations that I could have used this week.




First, we have the friendly-touchy feely hippy alarm clock known as the SleepTracker.  This watch is supposed to be able to keep track of your sleep patterns and only wake you when you are at the lightest portion, which is supposed to leave you feeling rested and fresh.  The review was actually glowing, so maybe there is something to it.




Here's [a link to the company site](https://wx15.registeredsite.com/user1041215/order.aspx), and [a link to the product review](http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/sleeptracker_watch_review_03221147/).




Then, we have an alarm clock that is a little less friendly.  In fact, it is a diabolical device that I would most certainly smash to bits within a week.  Basically it's an alarm clock that has rubberized wheels.  Once it goes off and you hit the snooze button, the wheels engage, and it rolls off your bedside table, randomly bumping into things until it finds a hiding spot.  Then when the snooze timer ends, it goes off again, only this time you have to get out of bed and find the damn thing to shut it off.  The idea is once you do this, you are fully awake, and enraged.  The designer made it furry in the hopes that you would find it too cute to smash, I guess.  I would happily heave it out the window once I found it the first time, I would expect.




Anyway, [here's the link](http://bicillin.media.mit.edu/clocky/), you decide whether you are really that narcoleptic to need something like this.
