I try to keep the hardcore nerd content off the radar here, since it probably only makes sense to two other people I know who might even casually glance at this blog.Â  Anyway, I will make an exception today just for fun.Â  In my current contract I'm back to full on mail server nerd and was doing some documentation this morning when I came across this antivirus scanner option:

Illegal MIME header action

Cue immature nerdly snickering and snorting, while pushing up my horn-rimmed glasses.Â  Fnar fnar fnar.

Caffeine + sleep deprivation + early morning = giddy geek

I know I'm a geek, it pays the bills ok?
