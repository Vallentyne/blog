Hi there.

It's been over a week since anybody posted a damn thing.

But that's ok.  It's summer after all.

What news?  Well let's see.  Jordy had her dance recital and kicked some major butt.  Nikki and Quinn got smacked by a speeding car in the Walmart parking lot (ok, it was more like a low speed push, and nobody got hurt, Quinn didn't even notice).  I have done nothing of any great importance.  On the annoying side of things, we have been rained out of paintball twice in a row now, I'm starting to think we are jinxed.  I will be helping Good Neighbour Jim build the "Doucette Dream Deck"(tm) sometime next month.  That should be a hoot, since I get to learn how to do it while screwing up someone else's deck.  Hee hee.

Yep, that pretty much covers it from our end.

Later.
