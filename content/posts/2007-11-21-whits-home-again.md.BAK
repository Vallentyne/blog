Since Nikki's email update won't hit until later tonight, I thought I would throw out a note to say Whit got home today and is feeling excellent.

Thanks to everyone who sent notes and thoughts and prayers our way, it helped a lot.

Now we just have to get Melvin back home.....Â  that's not going to be so fun since we are very attached to the little guy.
