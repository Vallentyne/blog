[Wilson](http://robertwilsonphoto.com) reminded me today about [Ask A Ninja](http://www.askaninja.com) and how frigging funny it is.  It's essentially an advice column where people write in and ask the Ninja questions, he answers them and then he usually kills them.  Always very very funny.  And he has a very cool theme song.

Here's a taste, one of Wilson's favourite's:  Minjas



I posted about this guy [before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/03/git_along_video.html), he's even more consistently funny now I think.
