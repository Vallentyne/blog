And now on to other topics, and other deceptions.  Being that I'm a cheap bugger, I have more or less purchased every single piece of furniture I currently own at IKEA.  Their stuff is pretty durable, reasonably priced, and I take a child's delight in finding out how they have those things packed.  It's incredible, a grand piano fits into a shoe box.  Anyway, we don't really need to be thinking about this anytime soon, but IKEA has started phase 2 of their world domination plan.  Not content with a lock on my furniture dollar, you can now [buy your whole house](http://shopping.guardian.co.uk/household/story/0,1587,1403793,00.html?=rss) from them.




Yes, entire homes will soon be available if the pilot goes well in England.  And yes, they do come with some assembly required.  No joke, they arrive in pieces, packed in cardboard boxes.  I like this idea a lot, since I'm a mean allen key master.  The question is, how do you get it home, or to where home will be once you get there?
