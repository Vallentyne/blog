As any parent of children aged 2-6 years or so knows, [Blue's Clues](http://nickjr.co.uk/shows/blues/index.aspx) is actually one of the better shows around for kids.  I like it (ahem) for the kids of course because it's pretty simple and non-abrasive to parents.  That's a very very important factor, folks.  It also tends to use one long continuous shot instead of a lot of editing, which seems to make it more interesting to younger kids.

Anyway, all that aside, the whole point of this rather rambling post is to remind you of Steve.  Remember Steve?  He was the original host, kinda had a startling resemblance to Pee Wee Herman?  (Maybe that was just me.)  Anyway, a few years back Steve left the show, for parts unknown, to be replaced by another dude.  So, apparently in case you were wondering what happened to Steve, [Steve is now an indie rocker](http://www.steveswebpage.com/index.html).  Or rather, he used to be a couple of years back, that's the most recent entry on his blog. However, [all is not lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Burns) according to the all-powerful Wikipedia.   Wow, and weird.

[More Blue's Clues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue's_Clues) for the new parent or the truly bored.
