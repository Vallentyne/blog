I can't be sure but this might just be the brightest nerd moment for Mundane Ramblings.  My post a little while back about [lava sledding](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/07/luge_for_even_c.html) is #4 right now in Google searches for "lava sled".  Combine that with an Associated Press article that CNN picked up a few days ago about lava sledding, and the blog has had a very busy few days, or busy at least by my standards.
