A [girl in Washington](http://www.koin.com/Global/story.asp?S=7555585) started feeling ill while working her shift at McDonalds and went to the bathroom, accompanied by her friend who was concerned. These two Einsteins had an exchange that went like this:


<blockquote>

> 
> <blockquote>"I was like are you pregnant?" Herrera asked. "Because she was in the bathroom, and I'm like, are you pregnant? She says, I don't think so. A couple minutes later, she says the baby is coming out, and that's when I started freaking out."</blockquote>
> 
> 
</blockquote>


The mother's friend delivered the baby with the assitance of a 911 operator.

There's not much more to tell here, except that you can't help but wonder what the heck that girl thought was happening when the baby was kicking her and moving around? Here's hoping that kid grows up with a bit more sense than his mom.
