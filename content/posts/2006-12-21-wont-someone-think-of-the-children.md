There has been a serious lull in blog posting by yours truly lately.  I'm not sure why that is, the world is stranger and weirder than ever.  Fortunately Nikki has pulled more than her share of the load by posting some [truly funny](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/12/06/a-lesson-in-humility/) stuff recently.  It's a shame she doesn't have more time to write in this space because she definitely has good stuff to share, it's inevitable when you spend as much time with children as she does.

Anyway, I have only one link to share with you here today, it's a very funny article about how toys of old were incredibly dangerous by today's standards.  It doesn't appear on this list, but Nikki and I had a conversation about TinkerToys just the other day.  If you aren't aware, these were a kind of Lego-type toy made of wood shafts and hubs that could be connected in many ways to build things.  She thought that the boys would enjoy a set, and I said no even though I had them when I was young.  I remember what happened when you broke the wooden shafts, they became sharpened stakes suitable for building booby traps, hand weapons, projectiles, etc.  Even the wooden hubs had some heft to them, and would be perfect sling shot ammo.  So there you go, even though I try not to subscribe to the new "fear-based existence" for our kids I am right there, censoring their toys.  Oh well.

In the spirit of the season and of this post, I give you [the ten most dangerous toys of all time](http://www.radarmagazine.com/features/2006/12/toys.php).  As an amusing side note, I believe that Jordy actually has one of those disco balls....  let's see for how much longer after having read this.
