Some very [nice photography here](http://www.missouriskies.org), mostly skies and clouds and [amazing storms](http://www.missouriskies.org/june13_storm/june13_2004.html), but it's really very [nice to look at](http://www.pbase.com/missouri_skies/image/55624787).

AND the site does NOT use a Flash interface....   :-)  Take that, [Wilson](http://robertwilsonphoto.com).  But I will also readily admit that his site does not match yours for looks.  

I saw the link on Metafilter originally...
