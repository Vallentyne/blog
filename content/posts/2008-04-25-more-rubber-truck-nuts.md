Boy the repeat news stories abound this week.Â  First [Weekend at Bernie's](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/04/22/weekend-at-bernies-2/), and now rubber truck nuts have once again managed to dangle themselves into view.Â  For those of you just tuning in, we [talked about Virginian rubber truck nuts](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/17/aw-nuts/) (which basically are exactly what they sound like) and the moronic attempts of lawmakers to actually try to LEGISLATE other morons from putting these things on their trucks.

Anyway, it seems that this sickness has spread past Virginia, in fact it has sort of slumped southward and ended up hanging in (under?) penis-shaped Florida this time.Â  Once again lawmakers are [spending public money](http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN4O32105020080424) on this issue, it's that important.Â  There must be a huge outbreak of rubber truck nuts there for them to leap into action, and in Florida it's quite hot and steamy, so you know, maybe those rubber truck nuts are sagging a little lower than in Virginia. I can certainly see why they needed to act.Â  With the summer coming, it's conceivable that that's when the rubber nuts hit the road, and then you would have, ah, nut abrasion, which nobody wants.Â  Nobody.Â  Anyway, it seems that the law may not pass, unfortunately.Â  I think they should push for the only reasonable compromise: truck undies.Â  Yep, those rubber buddies need some support, son.Â  Strap them in to keep them safe from rocks and nut abrasion (I have a hard time just typing that).Â  Won't someone think of the fake testicles? It's a business model just crying out for a product.

Recalling [our last talk](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/17/aw-nuts/) on this matter, I decided that Rubber Truck Nut Lover was the best band name in the history of everything, and I still think so. If I ever start a band, it will most definitely be called that.Â  Mom will be so proud.

Here are some additional resources on this critical matter.
