Well looky looky who decided to post 2 blogs in as many days.  Who woulda saw that coming!  More news to report, and I 'm excited about it, so here I am!

Looks like this baby of ours is getting too big for his britches (or his current residence) so to speak.  We will be meeting this new not-so-little Vallentyne no later than Jan 7th as I will be induced if I don't go in before then.  We are presently sitting at over 8lbs, as of last week, so who knows what the potential for this guy could be by my normal due date of Jan 12th.  The doctor has decided to take pity on me and bring him out early.

Hopefully I can make it through the next 48 hours without giving birth, so I can be with the kids while they open their presents Christmas morning. After that folks, bring it on!

Love to everyone, and again, Merry Christmas!
