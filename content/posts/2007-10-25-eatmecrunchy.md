In a display of Internet coincidence that is probably familiar to anyone who spends any amount of time online, Nikki and I were recently discussing her extraordinarily strong aversion to soggy cereal.  It's something we have talked about before (as any married couple can attest to, you usually end up talking about weird stuff like this at some point), but she recently wished aloud that somebody could figure out how to keep her cereal dry while delivering just the right amount of milk at the right time.  I'm not afflicted with this syndrome myself, but I can allow that it's probably a big deal for some.

Anyway, here's the coincidence part.  [Boing Boing](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/171450536/eatmecrunchy-cereal.html) provided a timely link to a device that will probably change a lot of people's lives for the better.  It's the aptly named EatMeCrunchy cereal bowl, which features a sort of a cereal shelf to keep it high and dry while you eat from the cereal that's mixed just in time with milk. Here's a cross-section image I stole without permission from their website.

Brilliant.

Better yet, the whole thing comes apart and you just throw it in the dishwasher.  Doubly brilliant.
