["I will attempt to kill Ted Turner"](http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2000/08/31/floss/index.html)

I must say that while I can appreciate the anger over the tone of the news article, I can't really see how Ted Turner himself has direct involvement.  Pretty wild stuff, and all over plaque and flossing.

Check out the [product website](http://www.flossrings.com/), this is what he was fighting so hard to bring to the market.  It seems a little silly, to be honest.  I mean, if your fingers are already sore and stiff for some reason, why is tying dental floss to one of these things going to be easier on you?  And if they aren't, why bother taking the extra time?
