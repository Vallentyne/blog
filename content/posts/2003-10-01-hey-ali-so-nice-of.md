Hey Ali, so nice of you to come (crawling) back (on your belly) and (finally) post something on the blog (only after I shamed myself by practically begging).  - Ignore the words in parentheses.

I have a question, why is it "gubernatiorial"?  It is an election for the Governor.  Why don't they call it "governatorial"?  It sounds better than the other word.  Gubernatorial sounds rather juvenile to me, like goober.  I'm sure some English major could tell me.

So, Quinn did cast-off yesterday and he hasn't looked back since.  He was particularly good about it all, only momentarily concerned when they came at him with the big loud saw to cut the thing off.  His stitches don't look particularly appealing at the moment, Nikki can barely stand to see them at all.  He also has a disturbing morbid fascination with them at the moment and tends to pick at them.  It's kind of gross.

Still, he had a bath last night for the first time in 10 days and we are all the better for it.

One final garage sale note, I can't help but be a little put out that [Elton John has a garage sale](http://www.canoe.ca/JamMusic/sep30_elton-ap.html) and manages to make 2 million dollars.  Now, I'm not one to be unhappy with my place in life, but come on!  We didn't even come close to making 1 million, let alone over 2 million.  Jerk.
