Here's some proof that Nikki is a superhero.

This is an account of her day on Friday she sent me in an email:

2 loads of laundry - done
1 load of the dishwasher done/unloaded/reloading
1 adult showered
1 child showered
1 painful visit to ï¿½Bob the Builderï¿½ website to practice reading
2 sessions with ï¿½extra specialï¿½ markers
3 sessions of cleaning up the ï¿½extra specialï¿½ markers
1 lunch for 4 conquered
4 dozen buns made and
1 meatloaf for Sunday supper in the fridge
1 kitchen floor swept
4 kitchen counters ï¿½ spotless
1 stovetop - clean
2 boys down for a nap
And only 1 fight.

who else could survive a day like that but a superhero?
