The Church of England is [to issue a formal apology](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/2910447/Charles-Darwin-to-receive-apology-from-the-Church-of-England-for-rejecting-evolution.html) to Charles Darwin for rejecting his theory of evolution almost 150 years ago. Â I'm kind of impressed by this, actually. Â It probably won't help the radicals come to grips with their prejudice, but it's a nice gesture that might help to push things back towards sanity. Â Any shift in that direction, however slight, is a welcome change these days.


<blockquote>Opposition to evolutionary theories is still "a litmus test of faithfulness" for some Christian movements, the Church will admit. It will say that such attitudes owe much to a fear of perceived threats to Christianity.</blockquote>
