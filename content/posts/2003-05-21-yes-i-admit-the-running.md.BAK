Yes, I admit the running is becoming somewhat obsessive, but if I'm going to act out, this might as well be how I do it, right?  I was doing this for the social aspect initially...Esther made me promise to join a hashers running group--kind of a non-serious bunch of runners that get together once a week and do a pub run. They call themselves "drinkers with a running problem." More info at: [http://hash.neilogic.com](http://hash.neilogic.com/about.htm?XSID=4d51eb7d18dd6751ec13ba59fe44968b) Anyway, even though it isn't for serious runners, I didn't want to make an idiot of myself the first time out, so I thought I'd do some running on my own first. It's addictive, and I still haven't made it to one hasher night, for which Es has already given me a sound thrashing.

As for the BF measurement, they take it at Curves with a handheld electrofatsensor (That's the Latin name ;-).  I was really surprised at the difference between essential fat for men and women. I think it is 4% and 12%, respectively, although I suppose they're averaging in the 36D cups there :-p

By the way, many thanks to the Vallentynes for getting me caught up on TPB... that show just keeps getting better. The dialogue is always excellent, but even the little extra bits, such as Alex Lifeson in Ricky's clothes, or Julian in the tight black garbage-bag t-shirt, are pure genius.  My favourite line might have to be Bubbles saying "I'm not giving anybody an R".
