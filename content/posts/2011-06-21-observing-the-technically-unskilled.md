I will admit that there might have been a time, maybe two times*, that this has happened to me and the experience caused my very sanity to careen dangerously close to the guard rail, narrowly avoiding the plunge right into snarky geek valley.Â  Nobody likes a know-it-all and certainly nobody likes to feel stupid, but I have very very little patience for people who never get it. Ever.Â 

It's a personal flaw, I realize that.Â  I'm working on it.Â  In the meantime, here's a perfectly executed doodle that captures this kind of emotion for me.
