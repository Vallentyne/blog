Only weekly posts you say?  Pity.

Ah, what are ya gonna do?  No time, nothing to say, too busy, progressive dulling of wits due to lack of sleep, all contributing factors.  What's worse than a vanity blog with no readership?  A vanity blog with no readership and no content.  That's what we are talking about here people.  What does it say about me when I find myself boring lately?  Poor Nikki.  I mean really, I feel like I have absolutely nothing going on upstairs between the ears.  It's the kids, I say.  Sucking the marrow of life right from my bones, bless them.  They will have me worn right down to soft putty in a few more years.

Speaking of family, the updates are all good; Jordy is doing well in school and getting taller all the time, Quinn is talking more than ever; some of which we can even understand, and Cael is growing and eating and pooping.  As for Nikki she is feeling fine and looking great, just don't ask her about washing and sterilizing bottles.  Touchy, you might say.  Sensitive topic, you might say.  Downright unreasonable rage, you might say.

What else?  Not much, as I mentioned before.  We are thinking that another big skating day could be happening, and appropriately enough it's probably going to be on Feb 14th.  More details to come on that one.

For now, that's all.  I do mean to stock up on sarcasm and wit when I get the time, I'll let you know when that happens.
