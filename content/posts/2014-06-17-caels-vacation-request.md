I posted a couple of days ago about [Quinn's writing assignment ](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2014/06/09/quinns-favourite-hobby/)outlining just how much he enjoys breathing.Â  Today we have Cael, who is lobbying for a certain family trip, and he has some very specific reasons for it.

The cell phone pic really doesn't make it easy to read, so I will transcribe it here for you.


<blockquote>Dear Mom and Dad,

I hope your having a spectacular day.Â  I've been thinking maybe you could take me and Quinn to New York city.

I think I would have a better childhood if I traveled at least once.Â  I would have stories to tell to my friends and other family members.Â  The family would have great adventures to share.Â  Plus, it would be my 1st time seeing a national landmark like the Empire State Building.

I think it would be a good trip for you too, because it would be stress free and I don't think you will be commuting from America so, no work!Â  Just relaxing, I know you like relaxing Mom, you too Dad.

And we could see new things and learn about New York.Â  We could have more family time.Â  Plus we would have great memories.Â  And me, Quinn and Jordy would be too busy to fight or be bored because we will be having fun instead of fighting.

This is why I want to go to New York City.</blockquote>

So there you have it. As sound an argument as any I could come up with.
