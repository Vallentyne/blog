I caught a couple of interesting articles this morning on Slate.

The first was about [a bunch of strategies to help kids sleep](http://www.slate.com/id/2166888).  The article was more or less some common sense stuff, but they showed a study that said when kids have bad sleep habits parents' health is worse.  No shocker there, for sure.  I will brag here for a minute to mention that our kids never had any trouble going to sleep.  Sure I wish Cael would stay asleep a tiny bit longer in the morning, but what parent doesn't?  He goes to bed like a champ, and stays there all night.  Same with Quinn and Jordy.

Then there's an article that talks about how the government (the US government in this case) should be spending lots [more money on educating preschoolers](http://www.slate.com/id/2166852/fr/rss/).  Apparently the research shows that disadvantaged children that get early intensive academic programs are likely to earn more, stay out of jail, and not have teenage pregnancies.  The study claims that the savings in unenployment insurance, healthcare, and the costs for incarcerating these people more than pay back the initial investment in intensive daycare.  That's kind of an interesting angle, but it does seem sort of harsh.Â  Let's teach those little kids a lesson....

So there you go, a little Slate for you today.
