I really loved the delicious part about how the heads of the big three American car companies showed up at a [meeting with congress last week to beg for money](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,447749,00.html) and every one of them [flew in a private jet](http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/WallStreet/Story?id=6285739&page=1). Â Not together, but three separate private jets. Â The media went nuts (as it should). Â It takes clanking big nards to do that, I just think they are so out of touch with reality they had no idea what that looks like to normal people. Â 


<blockquote>(Ford CEO) Mulally made his case Tuesday before the committee saying he's cut expenses, laid-off workers and closed 17 plants.

Â 

"We have also reduced our work force by 51,000 employees in the past three years," Mulally said.</blockquote>


I'm sure those people you laid off are very happy to see that your life hasn't changed one iota, and you couldn't even manage to pretend to care. Â Even on the most crass, corporate level this makes no sense that they didn't see this coming. Â I mean, these guys have media handlers, don't they? Â Maybe they should after this debacle. Â Somebody to say;

"Uh maybe the private jet's a bad idea today, Rick."

"Whaat? Â How will I get there?"

"Well we do make lots of vehicles, you could probably find one of our cars around somewhere..."

"Drive? Â Aw, come on! Â That's like [a whole day](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=detroit&daddr=washington&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&sll=45.289665,-75.893432&sspn=0.010522,0.018132&g=28+Nairn+St,+Kanata,+ON,+Canada&ie=UTF8&ll=39.516755,-78.546753&spn=2.953439,4.641724&z=8)... Besides, our cars suck."

"Ok, well how about a first class plane ticket then?"

"What, like with other people in the plane at the same time? Â There might be someone else using my bathroom! Â Eww!"

Methinks with this kind of razor-sharp intellect at the helms of these behemoths we will be seeing nothing in the way of hope anytime soon for the American car makers. Â They can't even beg smart.

Now the spin begins of course, as GM [loudly trumpets](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081121/bs_nm/us_gm) that they are getting rid two of the seven(!) jets it had at the start of this year. Â That will really resonate with the average homeowner, for sure. Â I had to get rid of three of my very own jets just last month, as they were just too dirty to bother with cleaning 'em.

What a joke.
