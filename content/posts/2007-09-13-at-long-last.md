Today, "the big day" has finally come for the wee-est of wee men in our home.Â  Yes, it is true folks, little man Cael FINALLY FINALLY gets to go to his first day of school.Â  He has been such a joy to have around, with just the two of us in the afternoon BUT to the tune of Dr. Suess's "The Lorax" you could say,

School is school, and kids must go,

Regardless of mummies, with glummies y'know...

Only a select few my realize that the above is a rip off of the Brown Barbaloots... ah, I digress.

I will miss the little man, but he won't miss me, and that is all part of the whole mom gig we get ourselves into.Â  He'll wave me off, and run head first, full tilt into that classroom like he owns it...and he probably does work it as if he does.Â  He'll no doubt charm Miss Jane and Miss Shelley with those big blue eyes and strut his fine self out of there at 3:30 where I'll be waiting a third time this month to hear the glories of the first day.

Way to go little guy, it's finally your turn.[![cael-wishing-it-was-his-first-day-of-school.jpg](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/cael-wishing-it-was-his-first-day-of-school.jpg)
