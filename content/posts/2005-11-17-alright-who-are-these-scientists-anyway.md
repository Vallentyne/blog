An article on CNN that misses the point entirely.  The article describes in an amusing fashion how those darned sea otters just won't stay put when the wildlife biologists relocate them.  The thing that gets me is, why on earth would they have ever assumed that this would work?  It's really really flawed thinking, isn't it?  They spent millions on this program, and now they have to admit they are stupid in public.  I mean, check out the methods they use to catch otters:



<blockquote>After waiting for an otter to fall asleep, wildlife crews would sneak up beneath it with a propeller-powered craft manned by a diver and snare it in a net. The otter then would be flown in a chartered plane or driven hundreds of miles to a Northern California beach for re-release. Some died from the stress.

Total cost: $6,000 to $12,000 per otter.
</blockquote>



Oh my god.  How long do you have to wait underwater for an otter to fall asleep?  It's unbelievable.  This whole thing has a whole Professor Frink feel to it, actually.  "They came back?  Inconceivable!  They found their way back to their native habitat hundreds of miles away.  It's almost like the outdoors is their home.  Aw, for glaven out loud. Mm-hai."
