This morning Cael pokes my arm as I'm sleeping; "Dad. Â Dad!" Â I groggily roll over and he's standing there at 6:05am, it's pitch black, and he has a large black toque pulled down over his entire head, but is otherwise only wearing Batman underwear. Â That's probably what saved him, if he had been dressed I would have been spending the next few minutes changing my shorts and calming him down after a fat lip. Â "What are you doing, buddy?"

"Do I look like a robber to you?"

"Yes, you do. Â Now go back to bed."

Off he went to his room to ramble and bang around while I tried to pretend that I was able to get back to sleep.

How did that seem like a good idea to him? Â The smartest thing he did was poke my arm, and not Nikki's.
