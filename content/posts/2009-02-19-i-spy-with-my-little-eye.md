Forgive me the parental gushing post that is about to be placed before you.  Consider this your warning to skip away now before I load you up on an overdose of innocent sweetness.

It was family day this week and although the family was split up across the city during the day, I took it upon my self to scrounge up whatever Vallentyne's were left in the house and head out for milkshakes and lunch.  The scrounging only surfaced myself, Quinn and Cael.  Perfect, this little trio is going to lunch!  We brought dominoes, cards and played "I Spy".  When it was my turn, I told the boys the following, "I Spy with my little eye, something that is blue, there are four of them, and they are one of my favourite things to look at.  They are usually with me all the time too."  Well this challenge just ROCKED Quinn's world and Cael was hamming it up.  Turned out that I had to give them the answer, which of course was their blue eyes.

So, last night I'm tucking Quinn into bed and I said, "I Spy with my little eye something that is blue, and is one of my favourite things to look at."  He smiles and says, "My eyes."  I said, "Yep!  Good job!"

Well here is where the sweetness gauge gets cranked to friggin' 10!

He says, "I spy with my little eye, something that is SOOOO CUTE, and I love it SOOOO MUCH that it makes me want to cry inside."

I asked, "Is it your teddy bear?"

Quinn, "No. It's you!"

Well mop me up and wring me out!  There was nothing left of me but a big puddle.  What a sweetie. Hopefully my little man will still feel that way in his teenage years ;-)
