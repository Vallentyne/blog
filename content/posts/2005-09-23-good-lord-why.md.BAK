I mean, more power to this guy, especially if he is meeting a need, but who on earth buys these things?  It is a very very strange world.

Stolen from the [WFMU blog](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/):

[Pets In Uniform](http://www.petsinuniform.com/)

And then even more puzzling (I think):  [Dogs in Bee costumes](http://beedogs.com/index.htm)

This site doesn't even try to make any money, it exists simply for the joy of seeing these pictures.  

Oh, you don't have to thank me.
