Here's something I have a hard time figuring out.Â  A scientist is trying to find a way to make rubber more useful, ends up adding a component of urine to the regular ingredients, and whammo you get [self-healing rubber](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Science/2008/02/20/4862758-cp.html).Â  What made him think of that?Â  Did he run into a lot of problems during the process and just get pissed off?

I would like to apologize for the use of that most feeble pun.

The only thing that makes all of this ok is the reassuring fact that the scientist really hopes to make toys out of this stuff:


<blockquote>"The resulting material is a cross between silly putty and a rubber ball"</blockquote>


Well, that's certainly what every parent would want.Â  I definitely want my kids playing with nothing but piss-rubber toys (which is the trademarked product name) from now on.Â I want piss-rubber(tm) stains all over the walls and ceiling from the piss-rubber(tm)Â balls, naturally.Â Incidentally, piss-rubber(tm) would make a more than natural fit for a material to use to makeÂ [rubber truck nuts](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/17/aw-nuts/).
