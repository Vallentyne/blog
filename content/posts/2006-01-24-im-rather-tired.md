In the words of John Lennon, I'm So Tired:



<blockquote>I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no</blockquote>



And then in the words of Bob Dylan:



<blockquote>One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below.</blockquote>



sigh.  Ask Nikki what tired is.
