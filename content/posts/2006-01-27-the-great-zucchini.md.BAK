I have no idea why I started reading this article on the Washington Post, and about halfway through I realized I couldn't stop reading.  The Great Zucchini is the top children's entertainer in the Washington area, but his life is a shambles.

It's a superbly written article, a very interesting and heartwarming subject.  [Read it now](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/18/AR2006011801434_pf.html).

I actually left me a little misty-eyed, I'm not ashamed to say.  Tragic clown figure, and all that.
