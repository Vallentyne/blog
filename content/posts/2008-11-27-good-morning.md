Permit me a moment of frustration before I resume my customary snark.

This morning started off with a visit to the dentist's office. Â Usually not a big deal, but it's always a pain because of our uninsured status, it means the Visa card needs a filling. Â Upon leaving there, I notice I am out of windshield washer fluid, which Canadian cars consume faster than gasoline in the winter. Â No problem, stop at the gas station to get a jug. Â One small problem, it seems the hood on the Stratus has rusted shut and resists every attempt to open it. Â Huh. Â  I manage to shrug that one off and throw some snow on there and head out to work. Â As anyone who has tried that knows, the snow trick works for exactly 23 seconds on any road before the windsheild is completely opaque. Â Then begins my favourite activity of trying to draft right up onto the tail of the largest truck I can find,Â while driving completely blind mind you,Â to use the road spray to moisten my parched, waxy windshield enough to actually see while driving. Â It's a catch-22 that in order to see where you are going to must cozy up to the vehicles most likely to render you and your vehicle into a fine reddish metal slurry. Â Nevermind that I'm doing this while trying to drink a scalding "Tim Horton" gas station coffee tasting mostly like used engine oil. Â Mmm, splashy screamy. Â Finally I can more or less see somewhat, and then the game is to stay as far away as possible from any vehicle spray to protect my precious forward visibility. Â Fine, now it's time to make an appointment to fix the car. Â Call the mechanic with the lame joke "If you can get the hood open, you get to change the oil, ha ha.". Â He didn't find it funny.

Get off the Queensway, narrowly avoid tagging an angry-poet-hipster-dufus at the corner, proceed to parking garage while getting windshield entirely covered with crap, and becoming blind just as I enter the dark bowels of the garage, ignoring the ominous "Lot Full" sign. Â Then it's creep about the dimly lit garage, Magoo-like with my head hanging out the side window like a Labrador going to the beach. Â Park car, get up to the office roughly 1.5 hours later than normal and try to pretend that the previous 3 hours didn't happen. Â 

Just writing it all down has helped tremendously.

Thank you for your time.
