Another right foot has [washed ashore in BC](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/05/26/5669321-cp.html). We have [been here before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/02/18/left-foot-check-right-foot-crap-not-again/).Â  This makes 4 right feet in less than a year on 4 separate beaches in BC.

The police chief was not that optimistic on solving the case, but did seem to be flexible enough:


<blockquote>"Next year, we will do the hokey-pokey even if we don't get the left foot in."</blockquote>


I'm all out of puns on this one, it's just getting weirder.
