I rarely plug any games here, but since I accidentially stumbled on a good one, I thought I would pass it along with a warning to never never play it. Â I mean it, never ever click on the [Popcap](http://popcap.com) website and think "I have 10 minutes to spare, why not play a little [Peggle](http://www.popcap.com/games/peggle/)?" Â To do so is to fall into a pit of candy-coloured time sink-ing fun. Â This game is a brightly coloured soother that I burbled and cooed over for an hour last night without meaning to. Â It's digital crack, a perfectly crafted thing, more of a fun toy than a game. Â Don't touch it, I mean it.

So, once you have ignored my warning and fall into a hole in the space-time continuum, don't come crawling to me, ok? Â I'm busy trying to get this level finished off...

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggle) says Peggle was named one of the "5 Most Addictive Video Games of All Time".... Wikipedia never lies, so don't click it.
