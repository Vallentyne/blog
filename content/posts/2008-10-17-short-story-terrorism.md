At risk of revisiting a [recent school safety topic](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/10/13/ok-anybody-with-a-bigger-gun-than-mine-raise-your-hand-both-of-them/), here's one that doesn't involve guns of any sort, but rather a much more dangerous weapon: Â words. Â A [high school kid writes a story](http://www.lex18.com/Global/story.asp?S=2989614) about zombies taking over a high school. Â Sounds harmless (and it is), but apparently police didn't think so. Â They arrested him and are charging him with a "second-degree felony terrorist threatening charge". Â 

Even better? Â His grandparents narced on him when they found the story in his journal!

Now that's a loving family. Â Man, do I feel safe, getting that kid off the streets. Â Just the thought of that freak, writing away in his journal, _crafting short stories with his imagination_ instead of playing video games for hours or drinking beer like a good teenager should, it gives me the chills. Â What other trouble would he have gotten into if his sweet little old Nana hadn't dropped a dime on his skinny butt? Â 

The only thing I have to say is: Â that must be one facking fantastic story to get him thrown into jail at the tender age of 18. Â It must be absolutely bone-chillingly terrifying to warrant a terrorism charge. Â It must really take horror to a new level to be detained like this, even the act of reading it makes your hair turn white and your skin take on a ghastly pallor. Â The very existence of this story keeps the FBI up at night. Â It must because the author is charged with terrorism, right?

This kid definitely has a future in writing. Â Unless he ends up at Gitmo of course.
