Apparently gay penguins are way smarter than straight penguins, if [this article](http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=9787) is true. Â Not only are gay penguins attempting to steal eggs from straight penguins, apparently they are able to do so by replacing the eggs with round rocks. Â 


<blockquote>Keepers have segregated the couple after they caught them trying to trick straight birds into parting with their offspring by placing round stones at their feet and then running off with an egg.</blockquote>


It has become such an issue that the gay penguins have been shipped off to a sort of gay alcatraz and segregated from the dim-witted straight penguins so that the breeders can have babies in whatever obtuse fog they live their lives in. Â How on earth could they be fooled into thinking a rock is an egg? Â How good are they at parenting, anyway? Â Jeez.


<blockquote>"It's not discrimination. We have to fence them separately, otherwise the whole group will be disturbed during hatching time," they added.</blockquote>


Oh, I think that's discrimination alright. Â Anyway, what will the little penguins think when the gay ones are allowed back in after hatching season? Â Who are these flamboyant, debonair penguins with the snappy feathers? Â They don't look at all like my dopey parents, nossir.

In all honesty, it makes you really cheer for the same sex penguin community, doesn't it? Â Some Christian fundamentalist will probably be having a bird about this story really soon now..... (groan)

I saw this on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/11/26/cant-trust-those-gay-penguins/) first.
