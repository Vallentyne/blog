The [aforementioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/im_rather_tired.html) sleep deprivation continues unabated today.  But, instead of whining about it further I thought some other family updates would be of interest.

Cael is really taking up a lot of posting time [lately](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/operation_big_b.html), probably since he seems to be maturing very quickly.  We have moved on to the next phase of Operation Big Boy Bed, and he is now sleeping on the mattress on the floor the last two nights.  This is quite the change for him, as you can imagine and he thinks it's a great gag to be running around the room for the first while at the beginning of every nap.  Very liberating, I'm sure.  Anyway so far he has been very good and goes to sleep rather quickly considering Quinn would run around [all night long](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/03/hey_everybody_i.html) at this stage.  

To be honest, he forced our hand a bit at this game.  We really weren't planning on moving him to his bed this soon, although he is older now than Quinn was when he started sleeping in a bed.  No, the problem boiled up quickly because I noticed he had in fact, broken his playpen.  His incessant bouncing tore a hole in the bottom of the playpen, which is now basically garbage.  Ok, so that's not too surprising, it's not really made to be a permanent place to sleep.  

However, this isn't the only thing he has broken recently.  Yesterday Nikki told me that he was sitting on the Sit and Spin, which has up to now served Quinn very well, and basically snapped the central spoke in half with his two hands.  This is a thick plastic tube here people.  Nikki said that he was slightly bemused, and slightly disappointed that it didn't hold up.

So, to recap;

[Cael breaks baby bouncer](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2004/08/so_a_long_weeke.html)
[Cael breaks crib](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/timing_is_every.html)
Cael breaks playpen 
Cael breaks Sit and Spin

I wonder what will be next?

Which brings me to thought of this weekend.  We will be heading to the Gibcettes, er, the Dousons(?) to have dinner.  This should be lots of fun, we get to bring the kids to wreck their house, er, play there.  Some advice to Jim and Ali:  Put things away if you don't want them snapped or damaged, 'cause we're coming.

Let this be a warning.
