Hey there everyone,

Today marks "the-day-after" Cindy's birthday celebrations.  I wanted to thank you all for coming out. I had an awesome time dancing on the coffee table with you girls.  The guys (Courtney excepted) will hopefully yield to the strength and force of their overpowering desire to dance on the coffee table with us next time.  I won't hold my breath though.

It seems to me that this is the time for honourable mentions (not in any particular order)...

1st one goes out to Cindy herself.  Hail to the shooter queen!  I commend her on her ability to be a good sport, and abide by the rules stated at the beginning of the evening.  Doucette, I think she has a bone or two to pick with you.

2nd & 3rd honourable mentions go out to none other than Jim and Court.  The infectious and uncontrollable laughter following Vic Romano's sixth (and not before) mention of "contraceptive sponges".

4th mention goes out to Robbi who waited until the next day to tell Court that he was responsible for him nearly biting the end off his own tongue.  Apparently this was the result of a gregarious back slap from Court while he was enjoying (for the first time) the sixth mention of "contraceptive sponges".

5th mention goes out to Kyle who supplied the lads with flavoured cigars.

6th goes to Kent who provided the best Michael Jackson joke of the night, and Cindy for her delivery of said joke.

7th goes to Ali for an amazing cheesecake.  Truly decadent.

And last but not least, 8th mention goes to WHIT!  Well done on being the last one standing.  You put the rest of us to shame.

Well I'm going to sign off for now as I'm still rehydrating myself from yesterday.  Court and I managed to squeeze in a 2 1/2 hour nap with the boys (which is unheard of) and are in great shape considering.  Thanks Cindy for letting me tag along to the spa with you. I had a great time.

And finally...

__**HAPPY BIRTHDAY CINDY!!!!**__

Now...when's the next party???  I suggest an 80's party in April.  Who's in?
