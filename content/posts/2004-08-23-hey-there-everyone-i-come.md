If I forgot anyone, I'm so sorry!  I deserve to be forgotten on my next birthday if I did.
You guys rock.  I'm so lucky to have friends like all of you.  Thanks sooooooooo much!
All my love,
Nikki

PS - Extra special thanks to the most amazing man in the world.  My hubby.  I love you Sweetheart.  Thanks for a wonderful, special and never-ending birthday.  I hope I can do you justice in September. xoxoxo
