This perfectly captures what I look like in most pictures.Â  Expecially ones taken of myself.

Who am I kidding?Â  My smile doesn't ever look half as relaxed as this guy.Â  He's a natural.Â  What a showoff.Â  He obviously got his teeth whitened recently.

Associated [story](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8615859/Monkey-steals-camera-to-snap-himself.html):Â  Macaque steals photographer's camera, figures out how to take killer pictures with a pro cameraÂ in three seconds flat,Â hams it up, becomes Internet celebrity, blah blah, seen it a hundred times.

This guy has definitely got the chops to really make it.Â  Man.
