Basement update.

Pre-wiring is coming along nicely, I had to actually buy the pot lights this weekend to install them for the inspection.  I should be ready for that sometime this week, hopefully.  This is all once again thanks to neighbour Nick who came by on Friday night and we got a whole bunch of stuff done.  Total number of pot lights: 8, plus two central fixtures.  Total number of plugs: 9, plus 4 other outlets in the "shop" area.  Seems like a lot for just one room, eh?  It doesn't seem like a lot when you are doing it, we'll see how it looks.

I had a heck of a time on Sunday trying to drill the second run to the backyard for the outdoor speakers, I didn't exactly make a neat job of it.  I'm hoping the actual speakers I buy will cover the problem area....  That's the main problem with these projects, you have no-one to blame but yourself if it looks like crap.

Also I need to make some sense of the speaker wiring I had done when the house was built.  I haven't done anything with those wires yet, so I need to understand how I'm going to make use of them now.  Nikki will probably be delighted to one day not have wires hanging out of the wall everywhere.

We are approaching the drywall now, once I get these few things out of the way it will be time to clean up a bit and order the drywall.  It will really seem like a room when we get that done.
