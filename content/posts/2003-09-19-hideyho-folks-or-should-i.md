Hideyho folks, or should I say Arr, avast ye mateys.

Today is Talk Like a Pirate Day, don't forget.  Also in the news today, appropriately enough, is a hurricane.  Even the weather likes Talk Like a Pirate Day.

Anyway, what's up today.... Not too much.  Looks like work on the basement will continue this weekend instead of working on work, some weekend activities were cancelled suddenly yesterday.  That's good news for the basement.  Also, the date for the big garage sale has been set, it's Sept 27th.  That's good news for the garage, which has been accumulating junk at an alarming rate.  It's not much of a garage at the moment, more of a trash heap.  So, if you have any junk, er stuff you think you can sell, bring it on over and put a price tag on it.
