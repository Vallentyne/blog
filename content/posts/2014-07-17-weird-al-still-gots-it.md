Weird Al Yankovic has a new album coming out, and there has been a flurry of videos released recently for it.Â  Well this video is bordering on genius, and send up of common grammar mistakes.Â Â I have to say this kind of thing bothers the CRAP out of me.Â Â  I make mistakes from time to time like anyone, but some folks really have no idea what bad grammar is and how stupidÂ it makes them look.Â  This is a perfect send up of those folks, and happily the result is a much better song than the original.Â  By far.Â  Easily.

*Yes, that was intentional.Â  The other mistakes in this post are not intentional.
