A nice fun surprise on the weekend, Kyle and Rachel are hitched, or they will be as soon as Rachel says yes.

Way to go guys, Nik and I wish you all the best, we couldn't be happier for you.

However, there's just this little thing I want to make sure that Rachel doesn't forget, **The Ultimullet** as sported here, will become all yours.

Ouch, sorry Kyle.
