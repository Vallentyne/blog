So, this morning I wake up a little earlier than usual and start organizing the front hall closet, cleaning out old winter clothes from the basement, etc. Â  As a result I am in jeans, T-shirt and iPod earbuds when the boys are eating cereal. Â Quinn turns to me and says:

"Shouldn't you be at work?"

To which I reply:

"Um, I have been off work for three weeks now. Â Haven't you noticed that I'm around in the morning, and around in the afternoons?"

His response; "Oh yeah." Â Quinn may not be the most observant 7, almost 8 year old. Â He then says; "Hey, maybe you could get a job as a snowplow driver."

I respond and say; "Uh, you could almost say that I already have that job, ha ha...". Â The subtlety was lost on him, because he said "Wow, really?" and I had to explain that a snowplow driver is basically unemployed in the summer. Â Quinn is not at his best in the mornings....

Cael, ever helpful, pipes up and says "You should get a job as a night guard! (a la Night at the Museum, one of his favourite movies) Â You know what you would get then?"

There's basically no answer to this, so I say "What?"

His cheerful response; "Friends!"

So, friends, I guess it's back to the basement for me, at least until my shift at the museum starts tonight....
