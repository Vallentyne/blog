Ok.  So it turns out that I wasn't quite as "in the know" as I thought with the [Shrove Tuesday](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/02/note_to_self.html) thing.  Faithful reader Rawkrey provided a link that enlightened me somewhat, or as much as a heathen can be enlightened.

It's [from the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/shrovetuesday.shtml), that bastion of ehtics and morals, so it's veracity is undisputed.

Many apologies to anyone who actually listens to me here, I'm the comic relief contributor to Wilson's [sober social commentary](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/03/sikhs_can_carry.html)...
