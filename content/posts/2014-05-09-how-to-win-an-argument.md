It seems that Moreta FolchÂ is the Queen of winning arguments.Â  She had a little quarrel with her neighbours in Florida, it's not clear aboutÂ what exactly (she thought they were "unsavoury").Â Â  Anyway it seems that she got somewhat upset over the dispute and decided to END it.Â  I mean, end it once and for all, forever, not open for discussion, nope never nuh-uh.

[She bulldozed their home](http://metronews.ca/news/world/1028679/florida-woman-caps-dispute-with-neighbours-by-having-their-home-bulldozed/).

She called a bulldozer driver and hired him to demolish the trailer and septic tank where her neighbours lived.Â  She told the driver she owned it and wanted it gone.Â  The real owners arrived and found the bulldozer already in the process of destroying everything they owned.Â  So, they called the cops, and the predicable stuff is now happening with the courts.

But you gotta hand it to her, the bulldozer is a real closer.Â  There's just no comeback that works after that.
