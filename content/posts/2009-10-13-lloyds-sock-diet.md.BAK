I mentioned a few days ago that Lloyd had lost a round with a pair of socks, and I said the score was [1-0 for the socks](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/10/01/socks-1-lloyd-0/).Â  I had no idea at the time I would need to ever mention it again.Â  Now it seems I need to change the score from that first post to the more correct Socks 2, Lloyd 0.

As I had mentioned, Lloyd's nocturnal ramblings included snacking at the delectable, and ever-present laundry baskets in the hallway.Â  It seems he has developed a taste for socks, and when he stumbled onto the (rather glum) basket of widowed socks (some of these sock tragedies are no doubt due to him in the first place) he ate his fill.Â  So that's what he greeted us with on Saturday morning, the unmistakable sound of socks winning the battle, despite Lloyd's mighty efforts to keep them in his belly, they returned to us.Â  Three in one shot this time.Â  So, I cleaned that up while Lloyd watched mournfully (not much of an effort, he does almost everything mournfully).Â  Then Sunday morning the battle began anew.Â  I watched blearily from bed (there's no use jumping out of bed to help him, he does just fine by now by himself) as he fought and lost again.Â  I went to clean those up and noticed he is taking things up a notch.Â  This time it was three whole socks, and the toe chewed off another one.Â  I will give him credit, he aims high, although I'm not sure he has thought the whole thing through, because in the event he "wins" and successfully attempts to deliver a sock onto the front lawn, I'm thinking he won't be calling that a victory....

So, if we take an accounting of the tally, I believe it's Socks: 8.25, Lloyd: 0

Needless to say, we are now taking steps (ha!) to eliminate socks from Lloyd's diet altogether.
