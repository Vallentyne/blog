Of the many things I have read today and clicked on, this is the only thing I found that stuck in my head enough to write about.

[One Billion Mazes](http://www.onebillionmazes.com/)

Yes, it appears that there are one billion mazes on this site, available for free in pdf format.  I didn't count them, I'm just going on faith.  It also appears that they are of increasing difficulty, but again my highly scientific testing included exactly three (3) test cases: [puzzle number 1](http://www.onebillionmazes.com/?p=1), [puzzle number 571 million-something](http://www.onebillionmazes.com/?p=571028029), and [puzzle number almost 1 billion](http://www.onebillionmazes.com/?p=999999930).  They seem to get harder, although the second link seems way way harder than the almost 1 billionth puzzle, maybe they need some help rating them?

Anyway, you are welcome.  For the maze fan this is fairly important find, I would imagine.  Let me know when you have finished them all.

You have me and of course the original poster on Metafilter to thank.
