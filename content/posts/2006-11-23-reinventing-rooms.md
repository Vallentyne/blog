If your living room decor still relies on milk crates or cinder blocks, then you owe it to yourself to visit the newly launched Reinventing Rooms website.Â  This is a new design company started by some friends of ours, and from what I've seen they know their stuff.Â  But don't take it from me, since everybody knows that guys only know 4 colours anyway, we just aren't good at the soft skills of interior design.

Anyway, have a gander and call them if your curtains look suspiciously like your bedding.
