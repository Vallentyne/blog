But this one at least is pretty neat.  It's a kid playing one of those dancing video games, really really fast.  That alone would send me sprawling, but the kicker is (that was cheap) he's also juggling while dancing, and he never messes up.

[Check it out](http://www.m90.org/gallery/video/Qhrome-SoDeep0-3085.wmv), it's very neat.  Via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/) as always.
