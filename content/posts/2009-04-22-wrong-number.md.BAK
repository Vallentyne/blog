I had an interesting wrong number call at work today.Â  It went something like this:

"Hello?"

"Yes, this is Senator Smurgelsnort's office calling for Senator Grafelburt?"

"Oh wow do you have the wrong number.."

"Oops, I must have dialed wrong, I was looking for number so and so.."

...etc.

I honestly can't recall the Sentator's names, but would have changed them anyway to protect the innoce-oh who am I kidding, those guys probably aren't innocent in any way.Â  I would still have changed their names if only to protect the staffer who made the call, and then accidentally told me the number she was trying to call.Â  Maybe these numbers are in the public record anyway, I didn't check.

Still it seems that if I had the presence of mind at the time I could have had a bit more fun with this call...

"Yes, this is Senator Smurgelsnort's office calling for Senator Grafelburt?"

"Leave the money at the base of the statue and walk away.Â  If you bring anyone with you, the groundhog gets it."

or

"Yes, this is Senator Smurgelsnort's office calling for Senator Grafelburt?"

"Uh yes, he is quite, ah, interested in the return of his underthings, would now be a good time to come over and retrieve them?

or

"Yes, this is Senator Smurgelsnort's office calling for Senator Grafelburt?"

"He's having his genitals waxed at the moment, can I take a mesage?"

Any other suggestions for the next time they call?
