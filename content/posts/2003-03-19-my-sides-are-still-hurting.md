The last sentence made water come out my nose.  I was drinking water at the time so that's not as unusual as it sounds at first.

Hey Kent, POST something. You know, POST something?  POST!

Can you tell that I have finally figured out how to post pictures?  You would think that Wilson would be offering suggestions on how to make the blog better, but no, the f$&!er just sits there, laughing.  He only frigging writes code all day long you would think he could throw me a bone.  But no.

So you'll just have to wait until I finally figure it all out.

Kent, post man.
