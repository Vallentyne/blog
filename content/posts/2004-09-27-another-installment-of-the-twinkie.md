Another installment of the "Twinkie Grief Series"(tm) today.  As you [may have read](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/09/very-sad-note-in-business-today-from.htm) way back on Thursday, Interstate Bakeries is filing for Chapter 11 protection.  They make all sorts of wonderful goodness, as Kent will tell you, Twinkies being the chief of these.




Well, in case you wondered just how wonderful Twinkies actually are, I (once again from Boing Boing) discovered some hard Twinkie science today, [The T*W*I*N*K*I*E*S Project](http://www.twinkiesproject.com/index.html) (or Tests With Inorganic Noxious Kakes In Extreme Situations).  There is some real science here people, you really need to open your mind to the possible scientific uses of Twinkies.




Boy these guys really had some time on their hands.
