Judas Priest, but this is one frigging big bunny.  Take a look at this sucker, this is just ridiculous.  Apparently there has already been some investigative work to see if this is just a nice Photoshop job, and it seems to be [on the level](http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/giantrabbit.asp).  It weighs 22lbs, and can mistake your arm for a carrot.  Does anybody remember the Bugs Bunny episode where he was a prehistoric saber-toothed bunny?  This kind of makes me think of that....

Anyway,  I saw this on the very good [Table of Malcontents](http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2007/01/biggest_bunny.html).  Photo credit from [a link there](http://michaelcastellon.blogspot.com/2007/01/worlds-largest-rabbit.html).  Previous bunny rant by me [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/06/11/well-now-that-i-have/).
