Well, I have been far too busy to post anything of interest here (sorry folks), but while I was cleaning out the basement last night I stumbled upon a few more details to Quinn's plan to destroy his brother, which I [mentioned last week](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/12/07/quinns-plan-to-destroy-his-brother/).Â  It seems that Quinn is a cautious sort, and felt better having a couple of backup plans, each more cunning than the last, just in case there was a problem with a straightforward bombing of Cael's base.

Here's Plan B, for instance:

It says:





<blockquote>

> 
> Plan B
> 
> 

> 
> Well hes still making his plan I will sneak up on him and smash! his base.
>

</blockquote>




Again, simple and straightforward, it sounds a lot like Plan A, but with the element of surprise thrown in there.Â  I like it.




Then Plan C, which employs a decoy base, and there's just way Cael can escape this one.

Plan C


<blockquote>I will block his exit then he will bomb my base without me in it then I will desrove(? destroy?) his base</blockquote>


Ah the old switcheroo.Â  Oh yes, there's no way Cael could possibly escape from that dastardly plan.Â  Genius, genius I tell you.

There's lots missing from these plans of course, like detailed timetables, schematics, maps and munitions requisitions.Â  I'm sure they are hidden somewhere in the basement, I just haven't found them yet.

These events will unfold in due course, and history will be made in those moments, my friends.
