I'm late with the Christmas post, but what are you gonna do when you are having fun and being as lazy as possible?Â  A good time was had by all at our place this Christmas, I hope you had a great holiday as well.Â  The boys got Nerf dart guns this year, and so Nikki and I thought that the whole family should be armed, you know, for self preservation.Â  The ensuing war lasted about 45 minutes and was clearly the highlight of the whole day.Â  Here's Whit getting ready for some Nerf-style vengeance on someone, with Cael and Quinn who have her back.

You can see the results of her ill-fated attempt at a charge....

If you can't shoot your relatives at Christmas, when can you?
