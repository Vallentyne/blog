A [5 meter python ate a family's pet dog in Australia](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2008/02/27/4879296-ap.html) this week.Â  Even sadder still, the kids watched it happen.

But wait, before you feel terrible and sad for those poor kids, there's more.

The snake had been stalking the dog forÂ days before it actually attacked it.Â Â DAYS.Â  For some inexplicable reason the family did NOTHING to save their dog inÂ  days.Â  I mean yes, it's a big snake, but that's just the point, it's 5 fricking meters long, how did you miss it?Â  Seriously, that's just crazy.Â  How canÂ youÂ somehow not notice the huge killer reptile in your yard?


<blockquote>Douglas said the snake had actively stalked the dog for a number of days, and the family that owned the dog had actually seen it in the dog's bed, which was a sign it was out to get it.Â Â </blockquote>


Yeah, don'tÂ move the dog's bed into the house or anything.Â  And would it kill ya to let the dog pee in the front yard?Â  Or wherever the huge hungry snake ISN'T?Â 

**Hon, did you let Fluffy out for a pee?Â **

**Yep.**

**Did you check to see if the snake was there?**

**Yep.**

**Was it there?**

**Yep.**

**Oh, ok.**

It's not like the dog had much of a chance, it was a chihuahua for crying out loud.Â  What chance does a little dog like that have sleeping outdoors in a place like Australia?Â  You think I'm [too hard on Australia](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/28/canada-is-too-dangerous-for-australians/)?Â  Maybe.Â  Useless little dogs like that get eaten by owls and hawks in Canada, but at least you don't have DAYS to wait for that to happen.Â  It's sort of:

**Ok, go for a pee.Â  OOPS, wow look at that.Â  That's a big bird. Yep. He's gone.**

Â Have a good weekend, folks.
