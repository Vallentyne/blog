Krumping. Itâ€™s a thing, and I did it.

Go pee before you zumba....'nuff said.

Itâ€™s like line-dancing on crack, with more variety, way cooler, Latin and sexy

If you consume more than 250mls of water during your workout, it may not play nice with your stomach. (Limits not tested to evacuation but letâ€™s just trust that guideline, mmkay? Good. Moving on.)

I've never been more intimately acquainted with all the non-toned parts of me. Ever.

You can barely hear the pulsing, awesome and fun music over your ass and lungs screaming.

Your gym clothes slide off you after as though you were an oil slick.

The thought of a hot/warm shower afterward is as appealing as hot-tubbing with a bobcat.

By the time I convinced myself my own stench was worse than the thought of showering I had burned 650 calories. (This is more than any Greco or P90X workout I have ever done.)

I am a Latin goddess and didn't know it.

Once I nail these moves, my sexiness will be so great it will arrive 10 minutes ahead of me wherever I go.

I have never worked out with a bigger smile on my face in a room with complete strangers.

Here is what I think I look like doing Zumba:
