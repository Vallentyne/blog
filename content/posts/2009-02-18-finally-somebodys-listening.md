It seems that I have finally found someone to listen to my ideas, and it seems that the groundswell of support for me is finally beginning.Â  Just one week after [I proposed the idea](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/02/11/recession-fixer/), President Obama today announced that [I am a genius](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090218.wobamamortgage0218/BNStory/International/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20090218.wobamamortgage0218), and he will do exactly what I suggested.

Thank you, thank you.

The applause is deafening.Â  It took quite a while for the recognition, but this blog's 13 hits per day is finally paying off.

Look for more brilliant ideas here soon.Â  Eventually I will solve all of the world's problems.
