Here at work they were having a Halloween themed pancake breakfast set for Monday.  I guess they were going to serve pancakes with green food colouring to look like ooze or something.  It doesn't matter anyway.  I won't be attending, since those things give me the crepes.

Ok, that was bad, I'm sorry.
