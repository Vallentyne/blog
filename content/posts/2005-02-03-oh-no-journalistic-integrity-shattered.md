OH NO!  Journalistic integrity, shattered.  Reader trust, gone.  Credibility, lost.  Somehow I have been mislead by something I read on the Internet.  It seems impossible to believe, but apparently I read something on the Internet the other day that turned out be a lie.  I have deceived you, readers.  I'm sorry about that, sorrier than you could ever know.

It turns out that the [avalanche beer guy](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/01/heres-good-one.htm) I wrote about is a fake.  Here's [the damning evidence](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/03/avalanche_man_debunked/), I can take solace that The Register, a bastion of truth and honesty on the Internet if there ever was one, was also taken in.

Drat, and I really liked that one, too.
