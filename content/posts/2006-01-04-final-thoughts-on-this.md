One last mention (and let's not forget that Wilson has a Movable Type account and could make his own thoughts much more vocal than just [using comments](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/okay_i_definite_1.html#comment-36)), we agree there is no risk to having the pictures "out there" because they are low res and/or small, then why protect them so?  You are making a mistake in today's online world.

I give you this: [Google Image Search for robertwilsonphoto ](http://images.google.ca/images?q=robertwilsonphoto&svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&sa=G)

That's rather thin, don't you think?

Here's a compromise, provide a link to the image on the Flash pop up so that people can link to your stuff.  Your artistic integrity is intact, my geek nature is (somewhat) satisfied, although that won't be enough to fix your Google-ability.

And finally for heaven's sake man, there's no FREAKING WATERMARK on that photo I took.  I released it into the wild wild Internet, and now there's no way to tell who took that excellent photograph.

For shame.
