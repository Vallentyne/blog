Wow, those Brits really know how to worship.  This Easter [the BBC will do a live show](http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1695198,00.html?gusrc=rss) in the streets of Manchester, England.  Essentially, it will feature Jesus and friends singing pop songs from Oasis, Stone Roses, The Smiths, etc.

The gay and red light disctrict of Manchester is chosen as the set of Jerusalem, with the public encouraged to participate.



<blockquote>"The climax of the event sees Jesus sing the Smiths classic song Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now as he is being flayed by Roman soldiers. He will then come face-to-face with his Roman prosecutor Pontius Pilate with the two of them singing a duet of the Oasis hit Wonderwall"</blockquote>



The event has the full support of the Church of England.



<blockquote>"Canon Robin Gamble, canon evangelist at Manchester Cathedral, has been tasked with encouraging churchgoers to attend the event.  "I wouldn't know a Buzzcock from a ballcock so I couldn't really comment on the music. All I can say is that they are not doing a Christian service, it is a piece of contemporary theatre and that is going to get people to think about the story in modern terms,"</blockquote>



Now that's actually the smartest thing I have seen the Catholic Church do in a long time.  It's almost hard to believe, really.  The gay and red light district?  Pop music?  Wow.
