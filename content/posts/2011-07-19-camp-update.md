As promised, an update on camp time.Â  Nikki and I have discovered that coming home after work to an empty house sucks.Â  As a result we have been avoiding doing that, and have been eating out a LOT more than usual.Â  There is no way to avoid the quiet when we do get home, but at least the lack of dinnertime bustle isn't so obvious this way.Â  We had a great weekend, took Friday off to enjoy ourselves a bit and do some hiking in Gatineau Park (which was awesome).Â  We were doing pretty well overall, until last night when we got a letter from camp.Â  This is our only letter from the kids to date, mind you.Â  There was no date and no way to tell when it was written, it was from Quinn and it only contained 7 hastily writtenÂ words:

Needless to say, we called the camp to make sure that Quinn was ok and not having a miserable time.Â  The director called us back to reassure us that he had in fact been playing basketball with Quinn recently and he did in fact seem to be having a great time, something that his counsellors agreed with.Â  So the reason for this letter is still unknown, but it seems for now that he got over whatever it was that made him write this.Â  Nikki and I are burning with curiosity to know what happened, though.Â  It could have simply been a moment of homesickness, or maybe something didn't go his way.Â  It's hard to tell until we get them on Thursday, really.Â  Not exactly the camp letter we thought we would be getting, but hopefully something we will have a good laugh about on Thursday.

More to come!
