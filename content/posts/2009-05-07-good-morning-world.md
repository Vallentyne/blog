By GOD!  Some days you just want to sit on a revolving chair and sprout rainbows and gumdrops from your chest care bear style.

Kay, so maybe that is a bit much, but you really have to grab hold and harness the joy that comes from certain days.  Do I have any reason to be this happy?  Many.  Do I recognize them with this much vigor every day?  No so much - but I should.

Call it a life's inventory on all the good there is to be seen..  Call it counting your blessings.  Call it spring fever.  Call it whatever you want, but I'm just happy for all the good things that are part of my life.  If you are reading this...you are most likely one of those reasons.

I think the short days, the winter blahs, and all the sickness that makes up winter can often cloud over those things that make us happy.  Things like the best hugs ever from your soul mate, or your teenager - thank God I still get those ;-)  and let's not forget the hugs that are still full of baby fat, that will be trimmed down to solid muscle all too soon [Sigh].  Those things that complete us can get stuck behind a grayed over attitude during the long winter months.

If there is one thing I've noticed in my fast approaching middle-age, it is that my environment has a HUGE impact on my attitude.Â  If the house is cluttered, so is my head.  If the house is filthy, so is my mood.  If it is too cold to go outside, we all get a little stir-crazy.  Cabin-fever, if you will.

I rarely get to sit in my house and enjoy it.  I'm always in some "non-stop" mode either cleaning, working on stuff, cooking, laundry, or just helping the kids trash it.  All are very important things, but so is stopping to smell the roses.  Once the house is clean...it is important to grab that book and enjoy it for a little while, if only for 5 minutes.  Cuddle with the kids before they can leave your grasp and run like a tornado through the place.

Here's a sanity tip for ya:  Clean the house the day BEFORE you expect company, and not seconds before they arrive.  Otherwise you stop cleaning to entertain, and then stop entertaining to clean.  What is the sense or sanity in that? This way, you've put yourself first.  You can enjoy it before everyone else does :-) !

Well, I'm rambling on here (hence the site name), but that is generally my nature anyway.  Life is good.  I'm going to try to remind myself of that on the days that don't necessarily reflect my mood at the present moment.

Here's to rainbows and gumdrops days.
