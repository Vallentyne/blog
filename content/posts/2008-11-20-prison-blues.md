A prison inmate somehow [contracted a flesh eating bacteria](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/11/18/national/a090551S30.DTL&tsp=1)...

"...that required doctors to remove several pounds of flesh from his pelvic region. Â Surgeons made a replacement penis with skin from his thigh."

Oh, well then. Â A replacement penis. Â With spare penis skin that was on his leg. Â We all have that, of course. Â Sure, that's exactly the same as it was before, no doubt. Â He sued the state and got a settlement which could never be enough, I would imagine. Â Still I suppose he could be dead.Â 

This poor bugger (unfortunate choice of words, perhaps) will never get a leg up in life, that much seems certain.

The take-away mental note from this story: Â be good, because prison is very very very bad.

Saw this on Boing Boing.
