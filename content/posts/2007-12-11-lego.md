As the boys get older, I have been trying to insinuate Lego into their lives because that's what parents do, they want to force their kids into liking everythingÂ they liked when they were young.Â  Never mind that it hardly ever works, it's a parent thing and there's just no reasoning with parents.Â  Anyway, to that end I have been trying to subtly play up how totally cool Lego can be to play with.Â  I think it's starting to take with Quinn, and Cael loves getting Quinn to make him a Lego truck and plays with that (it's Cael's largest handicap that he has an older, capable brother since Cael never really has to try very hard for anything before Quinn will just do it for him).Â  Anyway, now that I have been helping the guys build a few things, we have already almost reached the limit of what we can build with the bricks we have.Â  Off to the Lego website (did I forget to mention how awesome this Internet thing is?)Â Â and have a look at what I can find up there.Â  The bulk brick bags of one colour aren't that cheap, but then again, how cool would it be to have a whole bucket of just one colour?Â  Anyway, the really cool stuff is in the kits anyway, such as this unbelievably geeky Star DestroyerÂ kit costing $400.Â

But look at it, holy crap.Â  This would certainly make a statement, wouldn't it?Â  Something like "I am a huge nerd."Â  or "The fact that I am married with kids is a statistic anomaly."Â  I mean I wouldn't want to have it in my house, but it would be a blast to build once.

And finally, I almost forgot to put the finishing touch on this post, which is the following impressive Halloween costume.Â  See above comment about the statistic unlikelihood that the wearer will actually procreate.

I saw the costume on the excellent [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2007/12/10/lego-minifig-costume/).
