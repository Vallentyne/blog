Today was the last day of Preschool for Cael...EVER.Â  Yep, his last day of school was today and thus marks the end of the days where I can say I have a "Preschooler" at home.Â  I think this really only hit me today.Â  Tugs at the heart strings, so it does - and pretty hard too.Â  Sure, I'm proud of the little guy.Â  His social skills (think Casanova) have left Courtney and I in complete admiration of our littlest man.Â  We thought he'd have trouble without his trusty side-kick Quinn, but much to our surprise, low and behold, the little guy can stand on his own two social feet just fine.Â  Drummed himself up a set of twin girlfriends to boot.Â  Not too shabby I'd say.

The whole "Last Day" thing completely escaped Cael though.Â  He just went about his social business like it was any other day.Â Â  The mom's and I had chats about how it would be sad to see it all end.Â  It is sad.Â  I choked back the odd tear or two when hugging the teachers good-bye.Â  These women really are a special breed there.Â  No doubt about it.Â  I have been familiar with the school system for nigh on 8 years now, and have yet to see patience and grace like these women.Â  Truly an inspiration, they are.

So it is with a heavy heart that I bid Cael's last days of "babyhood" adieu.Â  The graduation of my youngest out of preschool has definitely tugged harder than I thought it would on this old heart of mine.Â  After two others you think I'd be used to it.Â  I think with age comes more sentimentality and therefore seeing "the baby" go through their milestones makes mom's heart a little softer with a slight glistening on the lower lids of my welled up eyes, and let's not overlook the ever growing lump in my throat.

Cael, my little man, good job.Â  You graduated preschool today.Â  We can see how much you have changed over the last two years and you have come a long way.Â  You are an absolute joy to be around, and dad and I are so proud.
