I'm not sure what to say about this, but I'm thinking that this poor fella forgot his meds that day.  I did notice that he smoothly ignores the councillor when denied extra time at the mic, so I'm thinking this may not have been his only appearance at City Hall.

Another example of how nature says "[stay away and don't touch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA1hyqA6UTY)"

Yikes.
