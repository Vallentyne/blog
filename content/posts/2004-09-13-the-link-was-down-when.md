The link was down when I tried it, but [here are](http://www.whoot.org.nyud.net:8090/archives/000074.html) some details on somebody's homemade chocolate printer. Yes, the ink is melted chocolate.

Combine that sucker with the fingernail printer I [linked to previously](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/07/ok-this-is-so-weird-i-just-had-to-link.htm), and you've got a snack that goes anywhere, and looks good too.

Way too much time on their hands.
