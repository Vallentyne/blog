Wilson sends the goods again, this time with a link to [a story about a runway](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512111&in_page_id=1811) on a tiny island in the French West Indies.Â  The picture says it all, really.Â  It looks incredibly photoshopped but apparently is real enough.Â  I can't imagine waiting around on that road for planes to land, but maybe it's a local bravado thing.

I shouldn't send this kind of thing around where Nikki will see it since she is a, um, rather tentative flyer.Â  I barely got her on the plane for our honeymoon, she drugs herself silly just to get to the airport.Â  One day when we are able toÂ I want to do more travelling with her and with the kids, maybe not to this place though.
