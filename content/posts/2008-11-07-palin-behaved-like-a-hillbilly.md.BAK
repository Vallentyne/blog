I really did wonder what the heck they were doing when they picked this one to run next to the old guy. Â She turned their side from just another rich old guy running for president into a circus that made him seem foolish instead of just corrupt. Â It looks like her own team is out to rake her over the coals now that the election is lost.Â 

[The Knives come out for Sarah Palin](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081106.wpalin1106/BNStory/International/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081106.wpalin1106)

There's some good stuff in there. Â Apparently she wasn't aware that Africa was a continent, for example. Â She would have been a train wreck of epic proportions if she got into office, that much is clear. Â It's kind of scary how far she got, really. Â 

It makes me wonder what they will dig up about her next. Â Perhaps her 15 minutes in the spotlight isn't over yet, but probably for the wrong reasons.
