Here's some more poetry from Nik, who once again is too shy to post it herself.  This is quite a bit more light hearted in tone than last time....


<blockquote>**Bunnies**
Bunnies here bunnies there,
Bunnies hopping everywhere.
We love the bunnies as you can see,
We toss them carrots and celery.

Jordy and Quinn squeal with glee,
While counting bunnies, one two and three.
Harvey is put in position ï¿½Stayï¿½,
Until all bunnies have hopped away.

Daddy thinks weï¿½ll be overrun
By our cute little bunnies, having fun.
But we feed them when they are there,
Just to watch daddy pull out his hair.

They come by, night after night
Looking for a crunchy delight.
But daddy will call poppy to bring his gun,
To pick off those vermin one by one.</blockquote>


Now that's some nice work.  And yes, I will call Poppy if I have to, I'm telling ya don't take those bunnies for granted.  They have exponential procreation on their side.
