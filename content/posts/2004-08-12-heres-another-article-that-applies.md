Here's [another article](http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,64550,00.html) that applies to me. Funny how I only write about articles that apply to me? Maybe it's because I'm so damn self-centered. Or maybe it's because I think only of myself. Sometimes I never think about other people, that could be the reason. I find that's only because I'm a lot more interesting to myself than other people. One thing's for sure, regardless of what the cause is, I am going to have to take some time alone to consider this and how it could affect me.

Anyway, back to the article and me, it is an article on how they have produced a chemical that turns monkeys from procrastinating layabouts into focussed workaholics. Now that has some really interesting uses, especially since there's nothing I would like more than a workaholic monkey to get some things done around the house I have been putting off. Those guys can really work, when they have been doped up by scientists.

The article goes on to say that the monkeys were trained to push a level in response to visual cues on a screen. They got a drop of water as a reward each time. They got better at the task when given the drug. The only side effect of the workaholic drug is chronic thirstiness, as reported by the monkeys involved in the test.
