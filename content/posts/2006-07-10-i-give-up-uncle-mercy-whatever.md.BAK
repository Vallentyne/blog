I know when I have had enough.  I'm now old enough and mature enough to know my limits, and I am officially stating it:  Whatever I have done to trigger this streak of events, I am officially sorry and I want out now, please.  The last 3 months or so we have had a string of unfortunate events like I have never seen.  It's crazy.  Let me regale you with my tale of woe (also known as whining my butt off).

It's the appliances that really get me going.  In the last 3 months the following things have broken completely in our home:
- Furnace ($700)
- Washer ($200)
- Fridge ($200)
- House Alarm (negligible, but it still broke)
- Vacuum (threw away $250 canister vac, purchased $1100 central vac)
- Telephones (all phones in the house were deemed unworthy, fancy new set $170)

And finally, this week, whatever you do, don't ask Nikki about her dental work coming up on Thursday.  That sucker is the very large last straw on a very tired camel, if you know what I'm talking about.

Is it just me, or is this more than our fair share of crap goin' down?
