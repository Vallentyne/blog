It seems that the best way to accessorize your new car is with a new gun, at least for [a dealership in Missouri](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/05/22/5639301-ap.html).Â  A handgun, to be specific.Â  What better way to participate in freeway gun-play than with something small that fits easily into the glovebox of your new ride?Â  Yep, that's the kind of thinking we need more of, new innovative ways to encourage people to buy more guns, and let's associate them with cars too.Â  That's some smart thinkin'.Â  God Bless the USA.Â  [Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praise_the_Lord_and_Pass_the_Ammunition).
