Good lord, but [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) is fantastic.Â  The latest release is absolutely awesome, it's hard to believe that this is free software.

Anyway, this is nothing but a placeholder to test out the new theme, which is actually included with the latest Wordpress, which is also pretty awesome.Â  Lloyd is gazing balefully at you right now in the header image, but that's because that's the only image I had handy.Â  I will have to find something more appropriate.Â  Anyway, nice work on the Wordpress.Â  I likes it.
