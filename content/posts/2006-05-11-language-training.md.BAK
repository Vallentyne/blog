Last night I was getting Quinn back into bed after a bathroom run.  He still hadn't fallen asleep, despite it being 9:30 or so.  He was doing his usual routine of playing in the dark and being very very quiet.  So, he is telling me very seriously how he fixed whatever it was he was playing with by reading all about it in his tractor book.  Quinn is definitely not reading yet, so I thought that was pretty neat, and showed some imagination, to pretend to read.  I looked around on his bed and found the book and he said in his most serious voice with big wide eyes:  
"I didn't know the words Dad, so I read it in French."

Fair enough.  I guess we will have to work on that a bit....  :-)
