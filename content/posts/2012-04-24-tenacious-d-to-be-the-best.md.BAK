[Tenacious D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenacious_d) is one of the those things that you either get or you don't.Â  Personally I find Jack Black hilarious in this mode, so this is generally good fun for me.Â  First off a "news report" about how after the movie they made Kyle Gass goes nuts, while Jack becomes incredibly famous.Â  Also, a nice cameo from Val Kilmer...

Note: contains large bare male bellies

Then on the much more down to earth side of things, while on tour recently (not sure just how long ago) Jack sees a couple of 10 year old kids playing Bob Dylan in a town square and arranges to have them open for Tenacious D that very evening.Â  Completely awesome and unnecessary level of coolness for him to display, really.Â  Even if the whole thing is faked (doesn't feel like it, but I guess you never know these days), these kids are clearly having a great time playing in front of the crowd, still way cool stuff.
