I shouldn't say that too loudly, because one thing is for sure; the guys over at the [Official Rock Paper Scissors Site](http://www.worldrps.com/index.html) sure seem to take it seriously.  They have everything the newbie needs to know about the sport here, including an introduction to [strategy and gambits](http://www.worldrps.com/gambits.html), clearly a crucial part of any RPS education.  And yes, apparently it is also called Roshambo, among other things.  

They had the 2005 World Championships at the Steamwhistle brewery in Toronto recently.  

And now you know.
