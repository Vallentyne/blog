Cute pictures of animals on the Internet is more or less what the Internet was made for (well probably [not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porn), but almost). Â It's sad that we use the most wonderful communication and social media device since, um ever, to send each other pictures of animals instead of working or doing whatever we were supposed to be doing. Â 

Anyway, my point is you will never get rid of frivolous uses of the Internet, no matter what you do, so you may as well just start blogs dedicated to cute pictures of animals, that way all cuteness is concentrated into one intensely furry, [schmoopy](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=schmoopy) place.

Yes Whitney, that is his best side.

We do also have an entry, but I don't have his picture here, this one will have to do.

That is all.
