So here I am getting a police check done for the preschool.  Good.
- so our son can go to preschool, and I can do duty at the school.  

So here I am getting birth certificates for all our kids.  Good.
- so we have them and can get the universal and child tax benefit... late I know, but I'm on it now.

So here I am downloading forms for the universal and Child Tax Benefit and filling them out.  Good.
- so when I get the birth certificates I can send it all in.

So then I'm called re: police check about a name discrepancy.  Am I Daniels, or Vallentyne?  Oh GREAT!
- so they need a marriage certificate to prove that I am both those people

So here I am filing for a Marriage Certificate on line. Good.
- so I can prove who I am
- so our son can go to preschool.

So here I am downloading an application for a name change so that WHEN I GET MY MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE, I CAN GET MY MY NAME CHANGED SO THE NEXT TIME I NEED A POLICE CHECK COMPLETED I'LL HAVE THAT DONE!!!!  AHHHHHHH!

Could I possibly do more filing with ONTARIO LATELY!?!?!?!?

-3 birth certificates, comin' up
-3 kids qualifying for the Child Tax Benefit comin' up
-2 kids qualifying for the universal child tax benefit comin' up
-1 application for a certificate of marriage please 
-1 application for a name change please so that when I finally take myself out from all this government filing, they'll know who I am and Court can painlessly file for the DEATH CERTIFICATE!

Now I know it is my own fault for not doing all of this sooner, but c'mon... how can anyone get away with fraud with all this cross referencing.  Man!
