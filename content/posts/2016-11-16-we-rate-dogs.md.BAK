Just in case you aren't "with" the Twitters like those darn kids are, I have to say that few accounts are just as awesome as [We Rate Dogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates).Â  I would explain what it's all about, but it kinda does what it says on the label:Â  they rate dogs.Â  Witness....

Yeah, they are all pretty much like that.Â  The pictures of dogs (and sometimes other things) wouldn't be enough to be consistently interesting, but the humour is bang on.Â  Inside jokes abound, and despite being (wait for it) a one-trick pony, they have been at it a year now and there doesn't seem to be much chance of it all slowing down.Â Â  They're good dogs, Brent.
