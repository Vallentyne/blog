"About time, he's almost 11 months old for crying out loud" you might say.  Yes, you could say that, but I wouldn't say it anywhere near Cael now.  He used to be [quite dangerous](http://www.vallentyne.com/family/feral%20baby.jpg) once you got within his reach, but now his tactical strike range has increased dramatically.
