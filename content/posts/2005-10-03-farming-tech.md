Wired is running a [good article](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,68888,00.html?tw=wn_2techhead) about a [company](http://www.organitech.com) that wants to take a huge leap forward in food production technology.  The idea is to automate the growth of the plants as much as possible, everything is hydroponic, controlled and measured.  In this way you can reduce the waste of energy, water and eliminate the use of pesticides altogether, or in theory anyway.  It's a neat idea, and while the thought of reduced energy to grow food is a smashing idea, the article mentions that they are looking at the "wealthy consumer" market, which is a bit of a miss if you ask me.  The kicker with this process is they are going to be able to market the produce as "organic" and therefore be able to charge more for it.  I guess that's the way technology works most often, it starts out expensive at first and then gradually becomes cheaper and cheaper until it actually makes a difference to everyone.

Well, I can see that the farmer stereotype will be changing, it will more likely be trading the farmer's jack shirts and boots for..... the jack shirts and boots of the computer programmer.
