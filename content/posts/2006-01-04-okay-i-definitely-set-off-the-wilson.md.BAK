Alrighty....  My Flash-related comments yesterday didn't go unnoticed by Mr. Wilson, he [posted a comment](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2006/01/wilson_dont_loo.html#comment-35) to my rant.  His points are taken, but here's my re-rebuttal.

1. Looks are fine, I agree that this site in particular (and yours) are nice to look at.  I don't think that a non-Flash site necessarily means ugly, but I'm not a web designer at all....
2. First off, Google rank is invaluable advertising.  It's also free, you are crazy to throw that exposure away.  If Flash sites are expensive (not saying they aren't) in terms of either software costs or skilled labour and denote success, then....
3. .. how could you not care about Google rank and statistics?  If you don't get noticed, then your stuff doesn't get seen.  I'm not saying you would go out and take 200 pictures of owls because that's the most popular shot on your web site, but if you don't even know which one is the most popular you are blind.  Also, if new people can't find you and talk about you (link to you) then word of mouth only goes so far.  I can only assume that you would prefer to make a living at your passion, instead of having it as a hobby or part time business.  Ignore stats at your wallet's own peril.  :-)
4. As for your added bonus of protecting pictures, I can't imagine what's wrong with the screen grab I took from your site, it's the same size and pixel count as it appears on my own screen right from your own site.  No special tools required.  Again, that's why these are thumbnail quality pictures, not something you could take to a printer, but really what is the Flash protecting here again?

A spirited conversation, sir.
