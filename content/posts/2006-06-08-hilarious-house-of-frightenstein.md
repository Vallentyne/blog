A scant year since I [last bemoaned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/05/teary_eyed_i_re.html) the loss of this show, we now get it on TV again.  We got a Bell Expressvu dish installed recently and one of our channels was DejaVu, which has the real deal on once a day, it seems.  I quickly started to record these things, and I finally got a chance to sit down and watch one with Nikki the other night.

My first impression on watching this show for the first time in more than 20 years (oh crap that sounds bad) is I had no idea that the show was an hour long.  As a kid, it seemed that this show flickered by.  We watched an episode at random, and I must say it wasn't nearly as funny as I remember it to be.  The segments really brought back the memories though.  I think I will have to give another couple of episodes a shot before I pass further judgement.  Poor Nikki never watched the show as a kid, and so she had none of the rosy memories to fall back on.  I'm pretty sure she won't be watching the show with me again anytime soon.

Anyway, there you go.  Of course the place to go to remind yourself what this show is all about is lovingly documented at [www.frightenstein.com](http://www.frightenstein.com/).
