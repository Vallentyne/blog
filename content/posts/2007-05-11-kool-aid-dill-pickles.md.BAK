[â€œTheyâ€™re easy to make a gallon,â€ Ms. Williams said. â€œYou pull the pickles from the jar, cut them in halves, make double-strength Kool-Aid, add a pound of sugar, shake and let it sit â€” best in the refrigerator â€” for about a week.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/dining/09kool.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)

Holy crap, I can't decide if that sounds disgusting or not, but man I think I want to try one for myself.Â  I bet the kids would go bonkers for these things.Â  The colour alone is excellent, those are some funky pickles.Â  Saw this on Metafilter, I believe.
