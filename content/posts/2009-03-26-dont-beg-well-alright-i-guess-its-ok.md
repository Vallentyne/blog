It seems that if you run an airport and you just put in a new baggage handling system, you definitely don't want to test it with real baggage.Â  No sir.Â  That looks like a job for 12 tons of dog food.Â  That's just what [officials in Seattle did](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/404222_dogs24ww.html), and now they have a warehouse full of dog food they didn't know what to do with.Â  So they scratched their heads and thought about it for a while and then somebody said "Hey dogs would probably eat this stuff, they eat anything!" and so then they tried to drop off 12 tons of food at a local animal shelter.Â  That didn't go too well, the shelter said "No!" and rapped them on the nose with a rolled up paper.

So they did the only logical thing and donated the dog food to a local PERSONS food bank.Â  It's hard to turn off the sarcastic voice I usually write in, but I guess this really is the best thing to do, if you are looking for a handout for yourself, it's rather likely that your four legged friend is probably a tad hungry too.Â  Nice job, folks.

The best quote of the article goes to a city commissioner:


<blockquote>"Coming into an election season," Commissioner John Creighton said, "I think it's a pity that dogs resident in King County can't vote."</blockquote>


This guy is soo going to get his butt sniffed the next time he's at the park.
