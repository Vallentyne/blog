Just a quick note today.  I have about 2 minutes before Quinn wakes up for lunch.  This post is just to point out to everyone that 3:30PM this afternoon marks the start of March break.  This means STAY OUT OF WAL-MART!!!  Everyone and all their screaming kids will be there, hating the shopping experience, _and_ hating each other.

On another note; I am realizing that leaving my administrative position at Anderson Consulting, about 4 years ago, which entailed managing 9 executives... IS NOTHING compared to the social calendar of an 8 year old girl, the demands of a toddler, and the feeding schedule of a newborn!!!!  These executives are waaaay more demanding.  Fun as hell, but more demanding.

Good heavens.  I'm so glad I had experience in scheduling, travel, etc. before I left my job to manage children.  Courtney's busniness is nothing compared to working out Karate & Karate camp, Brownies, a sleepover or two, time with grandparents and great grandparents, AND not to mention squeeze in a movie with mom.  And that is just Jordy.

Ah well, I wouldn't have it any other way.
Happy March Break folks!
