Let me just start by saying this:  Admittedly, I have very little work to do today, just follow along with me here.

I was idly surfing along, clicktranced for a minute or twenty, and thought I would do some research and write a little follow-up piece to the Flight of the Conchords post [I wrote](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/07/12/flight-of-the-conchords/).  Nik and I absolutely love these guys.  We have been subjecting the Wilocks to it as well and they responded well enough.  You should start watching their show, absolutely the best new TV I have bothered to watch in a while.  Anyway there I was, just sort of cruising along, I found their pathetically out of date [official web site](http://www.conchords.co.nz/), and on there they have linked to a few [unofficial](http://www.conchords.net/) [fan](http://www.whatthefolk.net/) [sites](http://www.flightoftheconchords.com/).  It was by clicking through some of them that I found out the following incredibly useless information:

- Bret McKenzie (one of the Conchords) was in the Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring as an [extra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figwit).
- He played an elf, seen for literally one second in the council of Elrond scene.
- His on screen presence was apparently so smouldering he inspired a [huge](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/10/1041990093364.html) [cult following](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Figwit) of [smitten](http://www.figwitlives.net/) [women](http://whatthefolk.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=39).
- They named him Figwit (**F**rodo **i**s **g**reat...**w**ho **i**s **t**hat?)
- Figwit has a lot of hits if you [search for it on Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=figwit&hl=en&start=0&sa=N).
- It became such a [phenomenon](http://film.guardian.co.uk/lordoftherings/news/0,,859428,00.html) that Peter Jackson (the director) [decided](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-mxa0716watcher_archivejul16,0,7890012.story) to give Figwit a couple of lines in the final movie of the trilogy.

So, there you go.  Don't ask me why I bothered to tell you about it, but it did just help make some time pass before lunch.  The only real piece of actual news I have in this whole post is the potentially sad news that the Flight of the Conchords [may not be renewed for a second season](http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1436414520070814).Â  Here's hoping they give Figwit another go.

The Internet is a strange place, folks.
