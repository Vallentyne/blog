So the update today is that Nana J will be taking little Quinners for a wee holiday this weekend up to the trailer.  It is his turn to go up there for some one on one time.  We decided to make some cupcakes (hopefully they will be done in time) for him to take up with him for some treats.  

I said to Quinn he could maybe take some cupcakes with him and Cael said, "Me too?"  I said, "No, you already had your holiday remember, when Quinn didn't go?  You get to be here with mom and dad, just us."  Cael says, "I want a brother on the weekend."

I took that opportunity to show Quinn how much Cael loves him.  It was cute.  Quinn gave a big smile and just said a bashful, "yeah."

Yesterday I told Cael he had to go to his room and he started to cry and said, "But I want to play with my best buddy Quinners!"

Break my heart man!  Clearly dad and I just don't cut the mustard like Quinn does. 

This could potentially be a long...long weekend for Cael while his best buddy Quinners is up in Ladysmith.
