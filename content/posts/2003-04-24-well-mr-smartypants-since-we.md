Well, mr. smartypants, since we didn't GLUE the moulding to the wall, there was the little problem of the nail holes that we thought would look better if they were gone.  And then since the rest of the wall isn't really painted at all, well we thought that would look much better if we actually painted using a colour.

You think this is funny, eh?  Just you wait until the glow is off the house there mister, then we will see who is laughing.  I'm betting that Cindy can be a harsh taskmistress.  There's always something to be done, fixed, renovated, painted, etc.

Actually I pity the girl since she will probably have to do that work herself.....
