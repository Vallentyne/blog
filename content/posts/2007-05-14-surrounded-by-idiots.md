A cruise ship apparently driven by morons was [run aground today in Alaska](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/05/14/alaska.ship.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories), resulting in 200 people being evacuated from the ship by local fishermen.  Nice job, boys.

Then, we have a well duh moment by the people who run a nudist camp association.  Apparently they have just noticed that 90% of their members (pun incredibly, uncomfortably obvious) are 35 and older.  They are [trying to attract younger people to come and take it off](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/05/14/nudist.recruits.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories) by offering discounts, but without much luck.

And finally the utter moron of the day award goes to the group of teachers who thought it would be a good idea to stage a **mock school shooting** with their class of 6th graders.  Like, [what the hell were they thinking](http://www.cnn.com/2007/EDUCATION/05/13/faked.attack.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)?

Predictably, the parents are freaking (as I would, and I'm sure as would most)....  These idiots deserve to be fired.

**Update from Boing Boing:Â  Apparently there's some spin at work here, the school board released a [press statement](http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070514/NEWS04/705140375).Â  I still think that the "prank" is in very very poor taste.
