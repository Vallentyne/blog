Age 8.  Man, who'da thought it would be so trying?  Girls are mean, bullies are plentiful, teachers and principals are idiots, and being sneaky becomes a new hobby.  I have to say that Jordy is still, by far, an awesome kid.  I forget that sometimes when she tries stuff out, that she is just that - a kid.  The irony of the whole thing is, when you get a good kid, it's a conscious effort not to come down hard.  It's an out of character thing.  It surprises us when we have to wear the disciplinarian hat.  




Ah well, some days are diamonds, some days are stones.  I wonder if the person who concocted that saying was thinking in terms of how rare diamonds are, in comparison to stones.




Either way, here's to a day of diamonds, I'm due.
