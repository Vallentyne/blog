Agreed.  By the way, we had a little outage this morning thanks to the good folks at Rogers.  My apologies on their behalf.

Cheers to Ali for the deep, thoughtful poem.  Jeers to the weather for messing up the Vallentyne's trip to Waterloo this weekend.

On the anti-war topic, (soon I will just get tired of posting Onion articles, but since they are better than anything I could contribute myself, it makes me feel like a big man, so whaddya gonna do?) [here's](http://www.theonion.com/onion3912/i_should_not_be.html) a nice one from The Onion.

And, without further ado, it's the weekend.

Later.
