I have a story to share today.

Last night I was out checking the rink, as any normal rink-obsessed human being would be doing, and I was just heading back inside when I heard a soft fluttering sound coming from the rink behind me.  I turned around, expecting to see a plastic bag blowing by, and was shocked to see a duck flat on it's butt spinning away from me on the ice.  I can only assume that from the air in the dark, when you are a duck that flies in the face of convention (ha) and don't migrate south, the rink might look like a body of water.  So the noise I heard was the sound of a duck's feathered ass making contact with the ice at -30C or so.  Harvey was with me and it was likely just as well that he didn't notice anything until the duck had almost finished sliding unceremoniously to the edge of the rink and decided with a honk of embarassment to get the heck out of there.  Then we both watched him fly off looking for some other backyard rink.

Ah, fun.
