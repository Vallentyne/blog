Time passes.  Days scamper by, heedless of human dramas unfolding.  Heartless celestial rhythm measuring out circadian fodder.

Actually, while that level of dispassionate observation is nice, life doesn't allow it at the moment.  Instead, life is currently measured by the dishwasher/laundry/Diaper Genie cycle.  I'm joking mostly, but sometimes there's just no time for anything else once you clean up the post-children blast radius each night.  

Yes, things are moving at an incredible rate in some respects.  The summer is flying by seemingly, although it's only just June.  Cael is growing and developing quickly lately but he's still only 17 months.  Quinn still flirts casually with becoming toilet-trained, yet can display incredible memory effortlessly.  Jordy is a mature young lady most of the time, but still inexplicably pushes well-known buttons with Nikki and I, but maybe now it's just for fun.

Ah, kids.  They're the worst and the best.

btw, Nikki has some news I will be able to write about more soon, it will be fun I think, but even busier somehow.
