Talk about sickening luck, this guy certainly seems to have more than his fair share.

First off, he's a US Senator.Â  He's already a millionaire.Â  On top of that he's the heir to the Kimberly-Clark fortune (they invented Kleenex, no doubt serious money there).Â  Apparently that's just not enough for this guy, because he says he spends at least $10 per week on the lottery.Â  That would be sickening all by itself, but to top it off, he has won the lottery three times in the last few years to the tune of over $250 000.

Give me a break, isn't that a little too much?Â  Man.
