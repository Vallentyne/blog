Thanks for the offer, Court, but I'll settle for your synopsis of Positively 4th Street. I gather that 9 months to read it, new baby or not, does not spell "ringing endorsement". By contrast, I bought "The Secret Life of Bees" for mom for Mother's Day and dipped in to it Tuesday to make sure it wouldn't offend her sensibilities. Ended up finishing it in 24 hours. The whole racial segregation thing Robbi sent a link about is covered, as the book is set in South Carolina in 1964.

On other topics: How about TPB last night? I can't believe the Government of Nova Scotia hasn't, uh, yanked its funding by now...
