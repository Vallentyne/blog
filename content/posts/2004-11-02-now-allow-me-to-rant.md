Now allow me to rant for a moment.  I do so in the most reverent manner possible, as is my usual manner, of course.

Holy crap technology sucks.

I can't seem to catch a good wave on the Internet connectivity ocean no matter what.  First it was Rogers and there oh-so-geek-friendly new IP address every six minutes policy.  It's like hide and seek trying to find the website, only there are 6 trillion places to hide.  Then I ponied up and got a DSL line with a static IP so I would have some stability.  Or so I thought.  Jeez Louise already.  Apparently DSL in Kanata (Silicon Valley North, as Wilson reminded me) is not all it's cracked up to be, or most probably just in our neighbourhood, but still.  So I decide to call the wireless guys.  Yep, maybe they say.  You might need to erect a 70ft tower, but it should work.  Ok, sign me up, the neighbours will love it.  Especially the one that's trying to sell his house.  Nothing brings 'em in like a pile of dirt and a couple of cherry pickers.

Ok, that last part was made up, but I did call them and they are coming to see if I need a 70 ft tower, which could happen.

Anyway.  In other news, Nikki and Cindy's jewelry business website is up, or at least the storefront for now.  You can check out some nice graphic design (a la Wilson)  at[ www.cynik.ca](http://www.cynik.ca).

Also, there are some pictures of the kids up in their Halloween costumes in [the usual spot](http://www.vallentyne.com/family).  They looked great, even Gourdo the Magnificent, resplendent in his gourdness.  I will leave that up to you to figure out who I'm talking about.

And finally, since I'm all about the subtle (Wilson) reminders, it occurs to me that I have not ONCE plugged a website (Wilson's) in all this time on the blog.  In case you don't know (Wilson) Rob Wilson has a (Robert Wilson) photography business, and his website is excellent.  You should go there right now.  The address is [www.robertwilsonphoto.com](http://www.robertwilsonphoto.com)  Tell him Large Marge sent ya.

I would plug my particular favourite shot on there by linking to it, but I can't since Mr. Fancy Pants web designer used Flash, so you can't tell what the links are.  Anyway, it's the shot of Quinn looking out the window in a dreamy manner, which is his normal manner of course.

That's all for now, now that I have redeemed my non-plug status of Wilson's site.  (Wilson)
