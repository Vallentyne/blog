Yes, it's true, the iPod Nano has finally arrived.  WOW!  Is that thing ever slick.  I saw the pictures, I saw the ads, I saw it in the Apple Store, but to have it unencumbered by security tethers, and busy marketing, it really is an impressive little gadget.  I look forward to saving up to buy my own.  I'm afraid though that getting my carpets cleaned may take priority over that.  Ah well, I can live vicariously through Jordynn, right?  Wrong.  I still want one.

Btw: in addition to the above, I need to make mention of the pure glee that came over her face when she found out it arrived.  The squeaking of joy, and attempts at muffling screams was really precious.  Again, I'm so proud of her.  Way to go Jordy...you do kick butt!  (that was what she had engraved on her Nano).  Love ya baby.
