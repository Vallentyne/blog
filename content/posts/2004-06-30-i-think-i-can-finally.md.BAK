I think I can finally say it out loud; we finally own a minivan.




The Sentra left on Monday with relatively little fuss.  (I know that actually there was tons of fuss prior to Monday, you don't have to remind me, I'm in my happy place now)  I picked up the new Sienna yesterday.  

Wow, now that's a nice minivan.  I'm old enough and mature enough now to say that without a hint of sarcasm or irony.  I used to say that I would never own a minivan, some of you will remember.  Well, that's all done now.  It is going to take some getting used to the size of that sucker though.  It's downright roomy on the inside, which means it's quite roomy on the outside.  It's not hard to drive though.




So, watch for the silver Vallentyne juggernaut on a highway near you.
