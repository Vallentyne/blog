On the music side of things, I have been getting more mature in my tastes. (Discerning readers will note a definite tone in this week's posts, mostly dealing with how unbelievably freakin' old I'm getting. I'm trying not to sound like a petulant old man here, but I'm ooooolllllldddd.)

But back to my topic; music. I find myself listening to way more music at work with my iPod of course. It's harder than it seems to find music you can listen to without it being distracting. And so there's a new angle I need to dig out; Music that's Conducive to Work.  Now there's a few categories of work naturally.  Cleaning the house requires something much more upbeat than sitting at the computer doing something that requires some thought.  I find John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Gord Lightfoot, Maroon 5, Johnny Cash (strictly American Recordings), Bob Dylan and Tom Rush to be good desk work companions.  I also find Audioslave, Foo Fighters and Jerry Reed to be very useful to clean the house with.

Any favourites?  Don't forget to say what you are doing when you listen to it.
