I have another couple of completely obvious, absolutely normal products whose development I consider basically inevitable and obvious.




First off, not much of a product really, but in case you suddenly find yourself disgustingly rich, there is something you can do to fix that.  Someone has taken great care to develop one of the most exclusive communities in the world, or so it would seem to me.  It's a group of [300 private islands ](http://guide.theemiratesnetwork.com/living/dubai/the_world_islands.php)arranged to imitate the map of the world.  For enough money you can buy your own island and live on what looks like your own continent.  As the Boing Boing post says, it's a supervillain lair if I ever saw one.  Being the complete nerd I am, I can't help but think of the absolutely excellent game of full-scale Risk you could have on this place.




And secondly, I can't think of a better innovation on the boring old band-aid than [this](http://www.mcphee.com/bigindex/current/11476.html).  Yes, that's Bacon Band Aids people, and I think that's brilliant.  Nothing says "heal my gaping wound" more than raw meat.  It's a natural fit with the maggot healing [we spoke about recently](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/04/dont_follow_thi.html), isn't it?  I mean, peel back the raw bacon and there you have: live maggots.  Perfectly normal.




Come on now, these are all things we need, and you can't tell me it's another sign that we are really losing it.  Well, you can but I can't promise I'm listening.
