Nikki wrote a wistful poem on parenting and middle age that I like and think is really good.  She didn't want me to post it but I think it's too good to not share.


<blockquote>The times have shifted, I never saw it dawn,
Those days we took for granted, are suddenly gone.
Our lives were our own, and times were carefree,
Now we attend funerals saying, ï¿½Thank God itï¿½s not me.ï¿½

One day youï¿½re a hero, the next you are not,
The thoughts of your child, tie your heartstrings in knots.
A daily routine of questioning your actions,
A balancing act of outcomes and reactions.

Preparing meals for babies born, or love ones lost,
The circle of life continues, our emotional scars embossed.
The greatest joy of all, can be followed by loss so great,
Tears flow regardless, itï¿½s true, we all can relate.

A midlife soul search is what has arisen
From watching friends that are sick, and parents bed ridden.
Attempts to enlighten the young, and help them realize
That one day your outlook will change - Surprise!

"Every day is a gift, take it from me!
It changes so fast, oh why canï¿½t you see?ï¿½

But that is the beauty of being so young,
There is so much to see, so many songs unsung.
ï¿½Donï¿½t listen to the parents, theyï¿½re jaded and tired
They donï¿½t understand how this generation is wired.ï¿½

Itï¿½s the ignorance that makes our children so precious
Why do we insist on making impressions?
They will find out soon enough, what makes this world tick
Best to sit back, let them fly, and be there for conflicts</blockquote>


Nice job, baby.
