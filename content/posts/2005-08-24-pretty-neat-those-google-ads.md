In case you folks aren't aware, the ads on this page are dynamic and are automatically selected based on the content shown here.  I did NOT select the religious ads shown here now because of the [Pastafarianism post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/08/heathen_like_me.html).

I could try and game the ads by mentioning, oh I don't know, [HP Printers](http://www.hp.com/united-states/consumer/gateway/printing_multifunction.html), for example, but that would be wrong.

Anyway, just a note to clear that up a bit.
