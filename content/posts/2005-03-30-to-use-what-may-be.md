To use what may be the biggest oxymoron ever; Holy Evolution Batman!




It looks like mother nature is taking steps to purge humans from the Earth, by any means necessary.  First, [the discovery](http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050321/full/050321-14.html) that octopi are capable of walking on two legs.  Check out the video on that site for what must be the funniest sign of humanity's impending doom I have ever seen.  I can't help but imagine that octopus is thinking "whoa! diver over there, I don't think he's seen me, just act casual, be cool, it's cool, nothing unusual to see, no plans for your apocalyptic demise..."




And then as if that wasn't enough, we have proof of mother nature's army in training: [vampire bats that can run](http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20050319/fob2.asp) on the ground as easily as they can fly.  Man, that's just enough to give me the chills.  Imagine, an army of vampire bats running people down in the streets, the mass panic as tiny, bloodsucking, winged mice carpet the landscape.  




If these two events aren't enough to spark worldwide panic, I don't know what could.  Unless you also happened to notice [this story](http://www.techimo.com/forum/t137704.html) about a catfish that will receive the  medal for "Exceptional Stupidity In Its Species".  Yep, this fella apparently attempted to eat a basketball whole and it got stuck in his mouth.  Somebody had to cut it out to "save his life".  So, I think we can rest a little easier tonight knowing that mother nature has some morons on her team, too.
