Remember [last year](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/07/holy_body_groom.html) I noticed that the folks at Philips were starting to market an electric razor they wanted men to use to shave, um, lots of things besides their faces?  Well they are back this year with a new URL, and a new campaign.  The site is excellent, very very funny and they do a good job of taking the "ick" out of the topic.

See it for yourself:  [www.shaveeverywhere.com](http://www.shaveeverywhere.com/)

If you click on nothing else, watch the music video.
