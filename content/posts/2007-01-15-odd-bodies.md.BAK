The best part about writing this blog is that I don't often have to make stuff up.  RSS is a wonderful source of fodder for this page, and it certainly hasn't failed me today.  I give you [the following article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/13/the_odd_body_gigantomastia/) on The Register, which is part of a series of "ask a doctor" type of articles.

It describes the strange condition of Gigantomastia, which is Latin for "a visit from the booby fairy".  Apparently it is a very uncommon condition (1 out of every 28,000 to 100,000 pregnancies) for pregnant ladies to wake up to find a sudden and rather permanent, uh augmentation shall we say.


"A 24-year-old woman, pregnant with her second child, had a â€œmassive bilateral breast enlargementâ€ during her 19th week of pregnancy. After the baby was born, it took 6 months of medical treatment for her breasts to reduce back to their normal size."


Not to make fun of what probably was rather traumatic experience (ok I'm making fun of it a bit), but I recall a scene from Bruce Almighty similar to this....

Anyway, that fun aside, there's just a gold mine of information up there:

That's enough for today, methinks.
