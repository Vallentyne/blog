I'd be careful there Wilson.  As I recall it, you were the one that WORKED there giving you waaaaay more access than even Court (or myself) to the goings on of said establishment.   This just opens up the conversation EVEN MORE to what that 15% of your spare time is consisting of.  Did they ever give you a key Robbi?
