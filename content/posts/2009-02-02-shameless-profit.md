While the "Big" 3 [dwindle and shrink dramatically](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/01/29/ford-loses-6-billion-insists-its-fine-really/) before our very eyes, it's kind of hard to ignore the contrast of Exxon Mobil reporting their largest profit ever.Â  Ever.

[$45 billion](http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090130.wexxonmobil0130/BNStory/Business/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20090130.wexxonmobil0130)

That's even after the price of oil tanking at the end of the year, falling 70% at times.Â  It makes you wonder just what the hell is going on here, doesn't it?Â  Not that I want us to be buying more gas in any way, but that is one hell of a profit (profit, as in AFTER expenses) for a year.Â  If the price of crude was so high (and it was) wouldn't profit go down?Â  Sure, you pass the cost of to your consumers, but this is still rather incredible don't you think?Â  These guys really know how to milkÂ  it, maybe someone should talk to them about that little global financial crisis thing.

Seems like there could be at least a little wiggle room in the price of a liter of gas, what do you think?
