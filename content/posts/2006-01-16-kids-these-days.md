..are way way more smartery than me.

In my daily search for content to mindlessly regurgitate here, I stumbled across this:  [Rubik's Cube World Record set](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/16/rubiks.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories).  A 20 year old solved the thing in 11.13 seconds, apparently.  My rationale for believing kids are smarter these days?  That beats my best time by about 21 years.  I've never beat one without disassembling it, or peeling the stickers.    It's very cathartic to talk about my secret shame, really.  

Man, that's fast.  It wasn't enough to beat the reigning champ though, a 15 year old kid who had a sub-15 second average to take the World Championship.
