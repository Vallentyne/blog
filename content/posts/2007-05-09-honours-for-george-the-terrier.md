Faithful reader Jeff P (ahem) sent me a note that apparently [George the terrier](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/05/02/tiny-terrier/) will be [honoured with two medals](http://news.yahoo.com/s/cpress/20070508/ca_pr_on_wo/new_zealand_hero_dog;_ylt=AufZuv1cTWe1G9WAsBnG2q9vaA8F) posthumously.Â  Apparently even though George was a New Zealander he will be receiving a U.S. Purple Heart for his efforts.Â  That's a nice follow up right there.Â  Thanks Jeff.
