If you listen to this video carefully with headphones on, you can actually hear the happy/terrifying sound of 42 Saint Bernards pantingÂ andÂ drooling in unison.Â  You can hear the steady slap of drool on the leaves from 40 slobbery mouths, it's rather soothing, like a rainforest.Â  This is from [a breeder in BC](http://www.lasquitesaintbernards.com/Lasquite_Saint_Bernards.html), and these dogs are beautiful.Â  Possibly not as beautiful as Lloyd, but I am biased.Â  Several things come to mind while watching this.Â  First, breeding Saint Bernards must be a losing proposition since every available dollar would by necessity be going towards buying dog food for this herd.Â  Wow.Â  Secondly, remind me to NEVER take a walk through those woods without my rubber boots on.Â  :-)

While living with even one St Bernard has at times tested the limits of my love for dogs, this is simply awe-inspiring.Â  42 Saint Bernards.Â  I can barely keep Lloyd this clean and he lives indoors.Â  Amazing.
