When I caught this story about a grandmother, mother and children all [caught together while shoplifting](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/01/25/4794042-ap.html) from a store, I thought to myself; man what a perfect racket.Â  I mean who would ever suspect a whole family like that?Â  It's the perfect way to get away with stealing something, really.Â 

These folks were caught while stealing from a Target store, which is sort of a lot like, oh say, an Old NavyÂ up here.Â  Yeah, apparently they were caught on video opening boxes and stuffing the contents into their bags and backpacks.Â  That was probably why they got caught, if they had just stuck to putting things into something less obvious, like say a **stroller**, they definitely would have gotten away with it.Â  I'm positive of it.Â  Absolutely sure of it, you could say.Â 

Don't ask me how I know this.
