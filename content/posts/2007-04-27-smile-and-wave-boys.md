You've got to hand it to this crocodile...  He looks rather smug.  You can almost see him with his buddies, high fives all around.  The story of it all is a vet had tried to sedate this spectacular beast, and apparently was unsuccessful.  He reached through the bars to remove the darts and the crocodile showed him what 440 pounds of disgruntled prehistoric dinosaur can do.

And, as you can see the vet will still be able to play patty cake with the grizzly bears, thanks to the wonder of modern science, and the fact that the croc got tired of his new digit-al playtoy.
