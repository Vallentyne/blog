Good lord, these are good ads, I have been laughing my butt off at them this morning.

They strike just the right combination of silly and funny.

This one is my favourite, for sure.

The [OldSpice YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/oldspice) has more, and the video descriptions are part of the joke, which is where the title of the post came from.

Saw this on[ Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2010/02/09/old-spices-manmercials/), nice find.
