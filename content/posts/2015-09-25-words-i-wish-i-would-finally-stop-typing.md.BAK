As an IT person, I type things a lot.Â  I type the same things a lot, even.Â  However, despite LITERALLY years of experience and practice typing some of the same damn things my fingers stubbornly refuse to learn some of them.Â  I mean, it's pretty bad sometimes.

Here are some of my favourites.

    
    ip[config
    ipconig
    etc


Ah yes, any nerd worth his salt knows this beauty.Â  And no, that damn bracket doesn't belong there.Â  But, despite probably 20 years of practice, that's what I type every damn time, or some jumble of things that look close, but not quite right.

    
    Microsoft Excahnge


So, I work for Microsoft now, but even before that I essentially lived and breathed Microsoft Exchange (an email server product) for YEARS.Â  Needless to say, I have probably typed that word a million times in my lifetime.Â  Have I even come close to achieving proficiency?Â  Nope.

And finally, the shortest most frustrating word that for whatever reason just won't come out right the first time:

    
    pign
    


Yeah, that's supposed to be ping.Â  Four letters.Â  Wrong like 75% of the time.Â  How is that even possible?

And all of this gets so much worse when someone is watching me type, it's like my fingers are giving a 4th grade speech in front of the school.

Thanks for reading, I feel much better now, exorcising those denoms.
