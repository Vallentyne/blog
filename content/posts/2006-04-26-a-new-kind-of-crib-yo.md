The designers of this entirely new baby crib definitely threw away all of the standard stuff when they went to the drawing board.  Lots of gadgets like video surveillance, a clear window instead of bars and automatic rocking mechanism (which I have [talked about before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/and_the_cradle.html)).  Pretty cool, if having your baby in an aquarium is your thing, I guess.  

The surveillance thing has also been [mentioned here before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/big_huggy_is_wa.html) with a different gadget, but I must say that video sure makes a lot of sense, if only for the gosh darned cuteness of it all.

Anyway, there you go.
