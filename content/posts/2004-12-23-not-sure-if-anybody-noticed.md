Not sure if anybody noticed this, but on Sunday we got buzzed by a low flying asteroid.  Really buzzed, like scary close.  The story is here: [Small Asteroid Passes Between Satellites and Earth](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/asteroid_close_041222.html).

It passed so close it was underneath the orbit of some satellites.

Cosmic, eh?
