This is basically a collection of strange videos that I haven't had time to mention before.

[The Little Girl Giant](http://www.devilducky.com/media/46655/) is a very trippy, and sometimes creepy video of a performance that is unlike anything I have ever seen.  It's hypnotic actually, and is a real testament to the performers, because that girl looks real after a while.

Then a couple of firearm related videos: first is a [marketing video for a shotgun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6bKbqSdNEc), but what gets me is the guy they get to demonstrate the gun.  This guy is an amazing shot.  Check out the redneck tricks, throwing up (by hand) 7 or 8 skeets and shooting them himself before they fall, throwing up a golf ball and shooting it a couple of times, even calling the direction he is going to deflect the ball, that's an incredible display of talent, no matter how red your neck is.

Finally some trippy [slow motion bullet video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7348957552702964257).  Pretty standard stuff, but it looks cool.

That's it.
