Forget the whole "that will kill you slowly and painfully" advice from those nervous nancy scientists, [Radon Gas is actually good for you](http://www.radonmine.com/index.html)!  Yes, you buy radon gas detectors to put into you basement so you won't die in your sleep, but this is a _different_ radon gas.  Really!

Lockrey, look at this thing and let us know how much radiation will actually kill us in comparison to their [measured exposure rates](http://www.radonmine.com/why.html).

Still, they do provide a full service facility, and their rates are reasonable.  They even provide complimentary "teeth cups" so you don't misplace the ones that fall out while you are "healed".
