Happy Birthday to Quinn.

We had a little "do" for grandparents and such last night, and the gift opening was quickly undone by the unwrapping of the first toy.  After that, there's no need for Quinn to continue, he's busy.  Jordy stepped in and did a fine job of unwrapping and reading cards aloud.

I can hardly blame the guy really, he must have been preoccupied with doubling his age in only a single year.  Your mortality staring you right in the face like that, it must be chilling.
