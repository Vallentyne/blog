Here's a good one.  A guy gets buried in his car by an avalanche.  He started to dig his way out of his car window but realizes that he will just end up filling the car full of snow.  If only he had a way to melt the snow.  Fortunately he had just been to the beer store.  He "happened" to have 60 bottles of beer in the back seat.  He also "happened" to really really like beer.  So, he proceeds to (slowly) dig his way out of the pile by scooping snow from above, packing it down, and urinating on it to melt it.  It took him four days.  It probably would have only taken him 4 hours if he had just poured the beer directly on the snow, but he isn't that stupid.  Anyone who buys beer 60 at a time doesn't seem the type to waste it.
