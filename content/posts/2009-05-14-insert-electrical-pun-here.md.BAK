Given that I need a bit of a jump start today, I thought these links were appropriate...

First we have a story about our next babysitter.

A prison official was giving a tour to some of his colleagues children at a jail in Florida when he decided to [show them what a stun gun feels like](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1176891/Prison-officer-zaps-children-50-000-volt-stun-gun-day-work-like.html).Â  One that is strong enough to be issued to prison officers, 50 000 volts.Â  Sigh.Â  Worse yet, it seems the parents gave their permission in the first place.Â  What the hell is in the water down there?

Of course he was fired, and then had the nards to be surprised about it.Â  Actually on second thought, let's hope he doesn't have those so we don't have to worry about accidental reproduction.

Moving on to something a little less electrifying, I saw this on [ZeFrank.com](http://www.zefrank.com/zesblog/archives/2009/05/electric_stimul.html) the other day and enjoyed it.Â  A little on the long side, but when you remember that it's 4 nerds giving themselves electric shocks to their faces on purpose, it becomes funny again.

Enjoy.
