I mentioned [last week](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/06/03/poop-happens/) that I would be digging a dog poop composter in the backyard, and in a fit of uncharacteristic efficiency I actually went and did it this weekend.Â  It was pretty easy, and took very little time.Â  I will let you know how well it composts poop in a year or so once it has had some time to really get rocking.

However, it seems that as a destination for neighborhood poop, it has been an unheralded success.Â  I finished digging the hole in our backyard at about 2:30pm or so, and by 7pm someone had already somehow identified what the buried bucket lid was for from afar, trespassed ONTO our backyard, and left a tied-up baggie of poop in the composter (btw completely wrecking the purpose of the composter).Â  That beats [Kevin Costner and his flipping baseball field](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/), he had to wait until dark.

Seriously though, what the heck is that all about?Â  Now what do I do if my poop hole becomes the most popular in the neighborhood?Â  If I put up a sign asking for "no plastic bags" does that not imply that anyone can leave their poop in my hole?Â  If I put up a sign that says "Private Poop Hole" is that not already implied?Â  I mean the hole is in my own backyard after all.Â  How do I keep stranger's poop out of my hole?Â  Does this paragraph make anyone else uncomfortable?

Who knew that just digging a hole would open up, ah, a can of worms?

Any poop hole privacy suggestions are welcome.
