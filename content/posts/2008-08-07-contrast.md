This is a study in contrast.Â  Let's see if you can spot it.

This morning as I got a coffee to take back to my desk to sip at while I worked in air conditioned comfort, I was mildy annoyed to see that they were out of lids at the coffee shop.Â  I took a lid that didn't fit and had to be careful not to spill all the way back to my desk.

[This woman](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/08/07/6375861-ap.html) was out for a nice donkey ride with her niece, got attacked by a lion, and managed to fight it off with a machete without receiving any injury.Â  She got the strength to fight the lion out of concern for her niece.

Did you spot it?
