Feigning ignorance about Web logs, Mr Web Developer? You make dissing you sooo easy, Wilson, honestly. Fish in a barrel. There's almost no fun in it anymore.

So, here's me, about to bore you with the one L two L story of my name. I know some of you have heard it before. (Perhaps the 'rents should have just called me Lana, as planned, and then none of this would be necessary.) Anyway, the short version is that Alison is the preferred and original spelling; Allison was a misprint on some ID, which became the basis of other pieces of ID, etc. Rivetting.
