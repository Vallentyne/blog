Well, there was some negative backlash about the Feral Baby.  I guess I should have seen it coming.  I don't want to point any fingers, or cause any trouble, but the Humane Society showed up and wanted to talk to us.  I guess it violates some sort of "code" to have a wild baby living in the ducts.  Sheesh.  It doesn't say that anywhere on their website, by the way.
So anyway they show up, and have a bit of an attitude about it all.  They set a live trap in the living room for Cael with a 10-pack of chocolate Timbits and a bucket of Orange Crush and needless to say they had him bagged and tagged in about 15 minutes flat.  I thought it was a bit of a cheap shot, myself.
They took him away that afternoon and when they brought him back the next day we hardly recognized him.  They had him shaved down, cleaned and disinfected, schooled, disciplined, perfumed, powdered and cultured him up real good.  He definitely doesn't bite us any more, but I'm not really sure if it's an improvement or not.  He seems a bit snobbish now, a little put off by us common folk.  You can kind of see it in his look, there's something about him that's a little better than the rest of us.

He also will only eat cucumber sandwiches and canapes, but you've got to hand it to those Humane Society people, they really know what they are doing.
