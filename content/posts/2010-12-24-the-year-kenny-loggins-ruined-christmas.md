Well it seems that we just might have a Christmas after all, despite my best efforts to let the children [see all of their gifts ahead of time](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2010/12/23/xmasleaks/).Â  In the spirit of the season, I think we should all realize that it IS possible to have a worse Christmas.Â  Witness [the tragedy of Hyperbole and a Half's childhood re-enactment of the story of baby Jesus](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/12/year-kenny-loggins-ruined-christmas.html).Â  Trust me, you won't regret it.

My god, Kenny Loggins?Â  I was crying by that point....
