I have an inspiration, I donâ€™t know his name.
I met his wife today after she swam the lanes.
She spoke of a day years ago on the 11th of November
Until she was on her deathbed, she swore sheâ€™d remember.

It was cold and slushy at the Montreal epitaph, 
She shook her head as she dressed, and gave a reflective laugh.
I thought it was fitting, given the date today,
And instead of rushing off to swim, I wanted to hear what else she had to say.

So I poked along with fussing with my goggles and cap
Her eyes widened with pride as she said, â€œMy husband swims 100 lapsâ€
I smiled brightly at her and said, â€˜Wow thatâ€™s a best for meâ€
With her gentle smile she said, â€œHeâ€™s 83â€

â€œHeâ€™s at home today heâ€™s feeling ill,
He had a gallbladder attack, and wants to swim still.â€
I smiled my best smile for her and his praises I spoke
I wished her the best day ever, with a lump in my throat.

With my head filled with food for thought,
I surmised that this man too, in the war fought.
His devoted wife clearly only has eyes for him,
With this little gift I headed to swim.

This little princess swims in a salt water pool
My kids are safe when they go to school
My family is happy, healthy and free
This man contributed to this cause, and I live the benefits, you see.

So think today about the sacrifices made,
Support our soldiers that are currently dodging grenades
For them there was war, there is war, pain and death, 
As for the rest of usâ€¦.Lest we forget.
