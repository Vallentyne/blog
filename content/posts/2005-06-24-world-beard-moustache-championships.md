...or as it's known: anti-social gathering of bush-men, academics, nerds, geeks, and pipe smokers.  It's in Berlin, Germany in October!

Man.  There are some fine examples of follicle follies on the [web site](http://www.worldbeardchampionships.com), I give you the [current world champion](http://www.worldbeardchampionships.com/chevalier%20pg.html).  

Nicely done.  There's a certain amount of courage involved in beard growth, and I must say this fella has "the eye of the tiger" so to speak.  It's sort of an obstinate, teeth-gritting sense of non-conformity that must drive these gentlemen to cultivate [beards that defy description, style, good sense, and good manners](http://www.worldbeardchampionships.com/Gallery/gallery.html).

And there's going to be a whole city full of these guys, their beards soaking up heroic quantities of beer to later evaporate in the general vicinity of late-night fraulein waitresses.  It is sure to bring a tear to her eye.  Nothing like stale beard-beer and sausage breath at 3am.  Unless the same mouth is also singing beer shanty songs in another language at ear-splitting levels.

Now that's a fun night.
