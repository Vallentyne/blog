Looks like the boys are [hobnobbing with some high-powered fans](http://www.infomedia.gc.ca/ps-sp/articles/unrestricted/2008/02/ps-20082145160965_68.htm). Or are those ministers the ones who are trying to get closer to the Trailer Park Boys? Nice to see the lads weren't deprived of a few drinks while talking with the suits. Julian with a beer though...?

I must say in that picture it looks like Ricky is an aspiring member of J-Roc's crew, much more so than his usual [Reveen](http://www.robertlamar.ca/Reveen_Photos.htm) look.

Nice tip from my Mom. Thanks Mom!
