It has been my pleasure to write this blog for you for years. Â I enjoy writing silly things, and the only person I really try to make laugh is myself, but if others find some of this stuff fun, all the better.

Since I run the blog, I know when someone writes a comment on a post. Â Recently I have been treated to some incredibly funny comments from our good friend Paula. Â It seems that Paula suffers from (self-induced?) insomnia while simultaneously being blessed with the ability to write hilarious comments. Â It doesn't pain me in the least (well just a little) to point out that Paula's comments are way funnier than the original posts themselves. Â The problem is that Paula seems to be reading the back catalog of posts, and so while I see the comments, the tragedy is that most people probably wouldn't because they are attached to posts I wrote years ago. Â So, here's a short (but happily growing) list of Paula's comments for us all to enjoy. Â Paula, please don't stop. Â I think that a feature post written by you would be a really good idea, and if anyone agrees with this idea after reading Paula's comments, then by all means sound off in the comments here!
