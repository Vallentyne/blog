A [plan to cut government funding](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2008/02/28/4882498-cp.html) for TV and filmsÂ that are deemed offensive or not in the public's interest sure sounds like trouble in my mind.Â  While I can appreciate that perhaps they don't want to be caughtÂ giving money toÂ people making pornos (although that's the only clear decision I can come to at the moment) the government is probably not going to be the best judge of art for anything that's close to the line.

It's funny but the Trailer Park Boys is mentioned in the article right away, despite the show being a hit it probably does offend just about everybody eventually.Â  In the best, funniest, least reverent way that I can imagine.Â  I can't see many church groups tuning in, if you know what I mean.Â  Fortunately Nikki and I are already tainted so it can't hurt us anymore.

Then again, as the article mentions there has alwaysÂ been at least a few checks and balances on this kind of funding (although the TPB have been receiving money from the beginning, so youÂ do kind of wonder just what kind of checks there really are)Â  and the government hasn't funded any pornos yet.Â  Or probably not any good ones.

So there you go, the wheel keeps turning.
