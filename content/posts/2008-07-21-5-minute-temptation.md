I need someone to give this a try at home pronto and let me know if it actually works.Â  [Make a chocolate cake in a coffee mug in your microwave](http://www.dizzy-dee.com/recipe/chocolate-cake-in-5-minutes).

While it looks rather like a cup of poop while it's rising (below) it looks darned appetizing once you get it out of the mug.

I'm thinking our children will fatten up nicely on a steady diet of mugcake twice a day.Â  Even better, I'm wondering what it would taste like with a little splash of Kahlua in the ingredients?

Now go, and bake, and report.
