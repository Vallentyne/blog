# Steve Earle, Sparkle and Shine





My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows sheâ€™s fine
She blesses all that she sees
A toss of her hair and a kiss in the breeze
But she donâ€™t love no one but me
And I canâ€™t believe sheâ€™s mine



Shimmering she moves
Sunlight all around her
Even when sheâ€™s blue
Silver clouds surround her



My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And I canâ€™t believe sheâ€™s mine



My baby swings down the street
Big tall high heel shoes on her feet
Walks by and my heart skips a beat
And Iâ€™m stumblinâ€™ like a fool
She give me somethinâ€™ so sweet
I canâ€™t sleep yâ€™all and I canâ€™t eat
Sparks fly whenever we meet
Iâ€™m breathless â€˜cause sheâ€™s so cool



Anywhere she goes
I can only follow
Sheâ€™ll be there I know
When I awake tomorrow



My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows sheâ€™s fine



My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows sheâ€™s fine


And everyone knows sheâ€™s mine



That is all.Â  Gag away if you feel so inclined..
