This morning I stopped at Starbucks on my way to work, as I do every morning without fail.Â  I gave my order to the cashier and she repeated it to the barista (a nice word for coffee schlepper) who looked at me, looked around helplessly and said, "But where's his cup?"

You see, I normally bring my own cup, which is rather identifiable, but had forgotten it on my desk the day before.Â  Also, clearly I have been spending way way too much money at Starbucks if this kind of thing happens.Â  So, on one hand I am doing my best to save the environment, but on the other hand I am clearly powerless when it comes to deliciously wonderful coffee, and this habit is sucking $5.37 out of my pocket every day, not to mention the caffeine I'm consuming.

Funny how things change.Â  Remember when I was [off caffeine altogether](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/04/20/a-small-lifestyle-change/)?Â  Remember when we discussed the merits of coffee:[ Timmies vs Good Coffee anywhere else](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/03/19/coffee-counter-intuitive/)?Â  (Special bonus is [this comment from Ali](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/03/19/coffee-counter-intuitive/#comment-53636), which I had forgotten about and which still makes me laugh)

My name is Courtney, and I like coffee.
