It seems that despite my own private concerns that they would elect another rich old white guy indistinguishable from the [recent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush) crop of [old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush) white [guys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton), Americans have [decided to believe in something a little bigger](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/05/us.reaction/). Â Nice job, I think the rest of the free world joins me in breathing a huge (if somewhat shaky) sigh of relief
