Yep, thought so.

Ah well, you guys will catch on soon enough.  Unbelievably I am now running Linux as part of the main Vallentyne.com infrastructure.  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.  In any case, that was the cause of the big blog interruption.  Blogger.com changed things around a little bit so that I was out of luck at home with the current setup.  It took me a long while to figure out how I was going to get it working again.  Enough with the technical jibber jabber you say?  Ok. Ok.

So far so good, unless I get hacked by some kid.

Fyi, the Mighty Quinn came through his toe surgery with flying colours.  For those that didn't know, Quinn had a freak toe.  This was caused by a little piece of bone that was beside his regular toe bone.  They removed this yesterday at CHEO under general anesthetic.  This caused Nikki and I a little bit of worry, needless to say.  But he was awesome and came through without any problems.  He wasn't even grumpy about having to stay more or less motionless all day.  The happy juice probably helped quite a bit there.  So he now has a large plaster cast on his leg to keep him out of the dressing

Here's Nikki's rundown of the day, in case she doesn't post it.

****************
The run down of the day is basically that we arrived at 7:00AM and he was as happy as a clam the whole time until about 8:00 when he started to get a bit hungry.  They took him then to the OR, and we expected to hear back around 8:45AM.  We didnï¿½t hear back until about 10:30 I guess, and the doctor who performed the surgery came to talk to us.  They managed to remove the tumor from his toe without any problems.  He also went in deeper and checked out his toe bone also.  He thinks the toe should shrink as a result of this procedure.  The tumor will be sent away and we will know most likely in two weeks if it is alright.  He did tell us however that he thinks it all looks fine and there should be no problem whatsoever.

The poor wee man is in a cast up to his knee for two weeks.  This puts a damper on the newly acquired skill to walk.  When we finally got the little guy back after he came out of his anesthetic, he was happy for all the staff and then decided to get upset when he saw us.  Figures.  We then had to stay until about 3:00 or 3:30 so he could have antibiotics given to him twice through an IV.  He was a perfect little child.  Very little upset him.  He sat in the crib and played, or sat on our knee and drank juice.  He had nothing substantial to eat until about 6:30 that night and was amazing the whole time.  Did I mention that the nosy little monkey didnï¿½t sleep AT ALL that whole time until 5 minutes before we left?  He slept through the nurse taking out his IV and then woke up for the drive home.  Heï¿½s so nosy that he had to keep tabs on all the other kids that were coming in crying, and recovering, and such.

In addition to all this, the poor guy had to wait an extra hour and a half past his next dose of codeine because the doctor forgot to put some info on his prescription that left us at Wal-Mart for an hour and a half waiting to have it filled.  We had to get in touch with the doctor personally and hand the cell phone over to the pharmacist to get things underway.  All the while Court walked up and down the aisles with Quinn while he practiced his evil laugh on passers by.  Heï¿½s a little trooper.

Anyway, Quinn has definitely earned the title of ï¿½The Mighty Quinnï¿½.  Heï¿½s happy as a toad today too.
**********************

I should add that Jordy was also a trooper because she stayed overnight at a friend's house, went to school all the next day and didn't find anything out about Quinn until she came home from school.  She gave him lots of kisses and hugs and is a very nice, thoughtful sister.

So, that's the scoop for today.

Later kids.
