It's not really a slow blog day at all, but my brain is completely non-functional.  It must be 27C here at work today.  Apparently the air conditioning was broken and didn't come on last night, so the air in the entire building is a steamy soup.  I'm so close to sleeping at my desk it's not funny.  My eyes don't even point in the same direction right now.  Factor in an incredibly busy weekend, no sleep and a slow work day, and I'm almost clinically brain dead.

Some regurgitated links:
- [Apple will be using Intel processors next year](http://news.com.com/Apple+shakes+hands+with+Intel/2009-1006_3-5733319.html?tag=cnetfd.sd)
This is nerdy news of the highest order, but really is considered to be quite a shock in the geek world.  It should make Apple computers even more compelling to me, if that is possible.
- Remember [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060254920/ref=sib_rdr_dp/102-0612257-3597749) when you were a kid?  I talked with someone about this book fairly recently, I can't remember who right now because my brain is too hot, but it's a classic.  Maybe it was Noonan?  Anyway, I think I will have to get it for the kids, apparently there are more than a few by this author, Maurice Sendak.  The pictures were amazing and thought-provoking.

I must melt now, I'm sure to cool off on the OC Transpo jammed in beside people I don't know who are falling asleep on me (or maybe I will fall asleep on them, it's a race today)...
