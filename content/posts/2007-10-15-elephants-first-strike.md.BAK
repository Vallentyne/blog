I have mentioned wild elephants before.  This is really taking it up a notch, though.  One hundred wild elephants [attack a small town in India](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2007/10/13/4573545-ap.html).  Literally, attack.  They swam across the river to the island town and now have occupied it for a week or so, eating and smashing.  The villagers are using firecrackers and bonfires to try to scare them away, with little success.

They should have used [chili bombs](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/08/26/world-perspective/).
