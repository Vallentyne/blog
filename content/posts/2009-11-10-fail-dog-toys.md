In case you can't read the blurry text, it says "If ball shows signs of wear, discard it."

Admittedly we didn't break the bank on these dog toys, but these tennis balls were not your average tennis balls, which have a shockingly short lifespan at my house.Â  These ones were much sturdier, and once gutted, smelled like reclaimed winter tires, dipped in turpentine, with just a hint of skunk.Â  There must be nicer smelling dog toys to be had, ones that last longer than ten minutes?

I tagged this Llife with Lloyd, but actually this particular mess was thanks to Harvey.Â  Don't get me wrong, I would rather clean up destroyed dog toys than my own destroyed possessions, but my dogs just don't like toys that they can't demolish.

Why?
