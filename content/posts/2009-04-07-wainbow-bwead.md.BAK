I'm as busy as can be at work, but I thought I would share this SIGNIFICANT use of the Internet with you today.Â  A radio jingle singer, doing lots of different takes on a bread commercial.Â  The music is darn good, and she has the pipes for sure.Â  The only strange thing is that she seems to have a speech impediment that gives this otherwise normal video a rather surreal tinge.

That, and the fact that at about 4 minutes in they decide to change the name of the bread company a couple of times.

And the fact that "pattycake" has anything to do with bread.

Just see if you can keep this damn song out of your head for the next couple of hours.Â  It's infectious.

That is all.
