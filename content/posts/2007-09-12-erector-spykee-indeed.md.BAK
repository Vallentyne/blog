Living vicariously through my children is definitely one of the best parts about having kids.  I am very excited about the possibility of Jordy saving up enough money for her iPod Nano soon, but that's another story.  The boys are also getting right into the sweet spot for very fun toys.  Lego is one thing that will figure importantly this Christmas, I think.

It also doesn't hurt that today's toys are seven kinds of awesome compared to the toys I had.  Here's [a good example](http://www.amazon.com/Nikko-America-870850E-Erector-Spykee/dp/B000N6470A), made by Erector.  It's a spy robot you build yourself, in three possible configurations.  It's got a video camera and microphone so you can see what the thing is seeing, and it has speakers too, for freaking out everybody including your dog.  That alone is great, but the best thing is the connectivity!  Oh my god, it's controllable over the internet with WiFi!  It's motion activated, so it can take a picture and/or send you an email when it detects motion.  It plays MP3s.Â  It will return to it's charger automatically and stay juiced up.  It slices, dices, purees, you get the idea.  The potential for mischief is limited only by your imagination.

My geek self is all riled up, I have no idea what I would use this for, but man it would be fun to play with.  If I gave it to the boys, poor Jordy wouldn't stand a chance.  They could take the annoying little brother thing to a whole new level.  If only the boys were a little older I could justify the rather hefty price tag ($300).  As it stands today, this delicate little robot would be smashed by an errant Matchbox "General Lee" in no time.  In answer to your next question, I'm still not sure if I would be buying it for the boys, or for me.  A little of both, to be sure.

I saw this on [Boing Boing Gadgets](http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/09/11/erector-spykee-kit-s.html), and have been drooling ever since.
