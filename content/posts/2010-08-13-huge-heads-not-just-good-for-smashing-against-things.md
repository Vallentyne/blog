It seems that scientists have discovered that the size of your skull can be a factor in [staving off the effects of Alzheimers](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/07/13/could-an-oversized-noggin-help-stave-off-the-effects-of-alzheimers/). Â Anyone who has met me in person and felt in person the force of my magnetic personality will understand perfectly when I say this: Â I win at the Alzheimer's game. Â I beat all of you. Â There is no winning against me, for my head is made of win.

Here's a little clarification for you; that's not my magnetic personality you are feeling, but rather the gravitational pull of my skull actually causing you to lean towards me. Â I have a huge head. Â Measurably so. Â I have never met a head bigger than mine, and it's a regular party gag to throw down and have a measure-off with anyone in the room. Â I am a skinny dude with an enormous melon, and nobody expects me to beat the huge guys with the muscles, but I do. Â When I finally lose the battle with hair loss it will probably be a lot more obvious, but for now I can safely say that I will out last any of you in the Alzheimer's department, and nobody knows it until the tape measures come out.

The most ironic thing of all is I have probably the worst memory (for some things). Â Just ask my wife Lorraine or especially my sister, um, Betty.
