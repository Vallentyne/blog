Faithful reader [Wilson](http://www.robertwilsonphoto.com/) (ok I made the faithful part up) points out that apparently mobile phone radiation (among other kinds of radiation) could be the cause of a [massive bee die-off recently in the US](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070329/bees_ccd_070329/20070329?hub=CTVNewsAt11).  That will definitely suck for us humans, since we apparently rely on these guys to do little things like make our food grow, not just make honey.

Canada is [affected](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2007/04/10/nb-beedisease.html?ref=rss), as well as [lots of other places](http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece).

The estimate is that bees pollinate one third of the food we eat every day.Â  That's a problem, folks.
