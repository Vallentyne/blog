[Here's a beauty](http://rollercycle.com/home).

It's basically a single-wheel motorcycle that you hang onto while you are wearing rollerblades.  The thing rolls along behind you, pushing you at speeds up to 25mph.  While that sure seems like a good idea, let's remember for a minute what you are doing.  First off, you are wearing rollerblades, equipment that is usually reserved for EXERCISING.  Usually exercise does not involve a gas powered machine to push your overweight body up the hill.  It's sort of the definition of "not exercising".

Then we have the unavoidable physics of the thing.  First off, as I mentioned, you are wearing rollerblades and travelling at 25mph.  I'm thinking the makers of the rollerblades weren't expecting you to be travelling that fast.  I'm betting that they didn't exactly make that rubber door stopper thing they call a brake to actually stop you from 25mph.  Fortunately the RollerCycle has brakes, a hand brake to be exact.  Keep in mind you hang onto this thing with the handlebars, and even if the brakes work, you probably won't be able to hang on, and are again subject to trying to stop on your rollerblades.
Beautiful.

Theres some video on the site, but they don't show any consequences, which I'm thinking are inevitable.

It's made for the lazy daredevil, I guess.
