I'm not exactly on top of American politics, or even Canadian politics for that matter, but I saw this guy on The Daily Show a while back and thought he seemed to be quite intelligent and sensible for an American senator.  It's pretty bad when I rely on The Daily Show to give me actual facts.

Anyway, here's a [really good and thought provoking speech](http://www.thinkprogress.org/obama-oil-speech/) he gave yesterday.  It's all about climate change, energy dependence and such, and it's very compelling.  I can't imagine an honest soul that wouldn't take this to heart, but I guess that's the point of his criticism of Bush's energy plans.  Anyway, have a read and think.
