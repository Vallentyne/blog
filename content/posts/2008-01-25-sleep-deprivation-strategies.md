I mentioned [how busy our days are](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/23/time-management/) and how there never seems to be any time left in our day.Â  Well, it turns out I know exactly how to get more out of your day.Â  It's so simple: [sleep less](http://howto.wired.com/wiredhowtos/index.cgi?page_name=cheat_on_the_need_to_sleep;action=display;category=Live).Â  A short-sighted solution you say?Â  Well, it turns out that a person can survive, nay thrive even, on an eye-bleeding regimen of aÂ nap every 4 hours instead of the 8 hours we have been told we need.Â  Now, you're not a schmuck, you're smart.Â  You read this blog, you must be smart.Â  So here's what you do:

Instead of going to bed tonight, have a nap for 30 minutes and wake up and carry on about your life.Â  After another 4 hours, have another 30 minute nap.Â  If you can actually wake up from that one, go ahead and clean the house, or whatever you are going to do with that extra 5 hours in every day.Â  That's all there is to it, 30 minutes every 4 hours.Â  If you can keep that up you will experience the wonder of being awake and bored all night long while the rest of the entire planet is sleeping.Â  It's genius, just stop sleeping so much and you will have more time than you know what to do with.Â  Forget about [drugs that make you not need any sleep](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/12/28/sleep-is-a-sickness/), those are for kids.

In the interest of experimentation, I hereby nominate myself to give this a try.Â  I wouldn't recommend anything to you folks thatÂ I haven't tried myself, of course.Â  I'm going to try it this weekend and see what happens.Â  Of course, there's lots of evidence that we really need that sleep, that if we don't sleep we get really sick and really weird, and even get fat.

Still, in the interest of science, I will give this a go and report back on how it all went.Â  Stay tuned.
