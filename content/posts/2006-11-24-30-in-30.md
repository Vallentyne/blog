If you remember [a while back](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/05/05/a-little-spooky-a-lot-fun/) when I posted about some online Flash cartoons that were pretty funny and cool, the same artist has posted a series of 30 cartoon shorts in 30 days.  They are very good, some of them are silly and some of them are gross.  [Check them out](http://www.biteycastle.com/main.html) for yourself, there's some serious talent here.

Some of my favourites are: Dry Lip, and Clifftop.  All good stuff.
