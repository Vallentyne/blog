Now, admittedly, this probably seemed like a pretty good idea at the time.  In fact, I am guessing that given the morning Nikki has had she is probably thinking it's a smashing idea right now.

A mom in England [left the house for a little while](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/29/webcam_kids/), and didn't get a babysitter for her children, ages 8, 10 and 13.  Now technically that may be on the very edge of "not so bad", but when you consider that she left the house for, oh say 5 days.  And, instead of like going for milk, let's say she went to Germany "to pick up some of her things".  How does that sound now?

What if her defence was she used a webcam to "keep in touch" with her kids?  Oh, well then, that makes everything fine.  Actually, no, because the police arrested her.
