Wilson knows I'm a slight LEGO geek, so he sent me this link of a time-lapsed video of someone building the LEGO Millenium Falcon (from Star Wars, Nikki).

The video is almost all I really wanted, I would have liked to make it myself, but I definitely don't want the thing in my house forever.  I just want to build these things once and then they can go away.  I wonder if anybody else has that compulsion, maybe there's a business to start there, renting huge LEGO sets to people.  Inventory would be a bit of a problem....

Anyway, here you go, for your viewing amusement.
