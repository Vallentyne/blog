Permit me to get a little geeky here for a minute, but for reasons known only to Google it seems that this blog, nay [THIS VERY POST](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/01/07/mushmom/) on this blog, has become THE go-to location for information on the Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids character known as Mushmouth.Â  I made a reference to this guy in a post about Nikki being cold all the time, and then went on a diversion about how the character that I always thought was Mushmouth was actually Dumb Donald (being the dude in the excellent toque with ocular orifices cut out).

Anyway, through the magic of page rank and the fact that there just aren't many other blogs that have the electrons to spare where it comes to discussing these weighty matters, it seems that when you search for the rather recognizable word "[Mushmouth](http://www.google.ca/search?sclient=psy&hl=en&site=&source=hp&q=mushmouth&btnG=Search)" on Google, two of the first images that comes up are hosted right on this very blog.Â  I would love to say that this is the result of clever search engine geekery on my part, but actually it's dumb (Donald) luck.

So what happens with this favourable ranking?Â  Well, people click on those pictures a lot, is what happens.Â  But how often do humans of the Earth (that are connected to the Internet) actually wonder enough about Mushmouth to Google for that word?Â  I can tell you:Â  a startling amount of times per day.Â  And some weeks, for whatever freakish reason, it goes absolutely bananas.Â  Here's a little chart of the blog traffic from the first week in December.Â  Let's see if you can tell when Mushmouth became a topic of interest for a short period...

Yes, Dec 4 was the most recent peak in Mushmouth's popularity.Â  The VAST majority of the traffic around that day was Mushmouth traffic.Â  To give you an idea of the power of this one topic, if I ran ads on the blog, I might have earned ALMOST $1 that day.Â  Yer darn right, wow.Â  Still, that's an incredible amount of traffic for this blog, and might I add quite likely the brightest that Mushmouth's star has ever shone.Â  There's no reason for me to share this with you, and you have likely gone off to some other shiny Internet thing by now, but one thing I have accomplished with this post?Â  Ever so slightly bumped my Google page rank for the word "Mushmouth"....
