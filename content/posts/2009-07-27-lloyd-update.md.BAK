A brief update on Lloyd, just for the record.

His height increases week to week have slowed, but he is now taller at the rump than Harvey.Â  His weight gain this week is pretty remarkable, he's now 60 lbs, and that means he gained 6 lbs in a week.Â  The mystery there becomes a lot less mysterious when you know that one day this week Cael helpfully fed Lloyd his lunch and accidentally left the lid of the dog food container open.Â  We can't be sure how much he ate, but judging by the amount and frequency of bowel movements that night, I'm thinking he had his fill.

Also, just for the record, Lloyd snores.Â  Shocker I know.Â  It was a very cute little rasp last month, but it's getting louder now, and I can't wait to hear what it sounds like when he puts on the rest of the bulk.Â  It's going to be like sharing a room with a college frat boy, 200lbs of snoring and farting exuberance.Â  Harvey is downright dainty next to this dog.

I complain, but really, it's so much fun.
