Just a quick one before I forget this, I was working on something around the house on the weekend and I was kneeling down.

I felt a draft and realized that I had better pull up my jeans, and I casually mentioned to Nikki that I had my Rob Ford Pants on.

Not the most original joke, but I made myself laugh and that's really what it's all about anyway right?
