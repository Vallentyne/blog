More strange news from Space.

Apparently the air above Mars is [getting a little crowded](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07941).  One of NASA's Mars orbiters photographed another of NASA's orbiters in the first such occurrence, but very likely not the last.  They just happened to be whizzing past each other and one sort of popped into the frame.  How long before the very first interstellar fender bender?  We obviously need space traffic reports to go with our [weather reports](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/05/nice_weather_we.html).

How many frigging satellites and rovers do they have up there?  It must be like a swarm of blackflies around the planet, and equally annoying to the Martians.  Is it wise to annoy our celestial neighbours?  I mean really, don't give them a reason to come over here and smack us with some Martian virus, or worse.

I can only imagine the stoppage of creaky scientist hearts involved in looking at those picture for the first time.  The mission control floor defibrillator got a workout that day.
