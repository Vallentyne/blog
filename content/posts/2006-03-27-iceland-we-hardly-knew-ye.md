Now, IANAG (I am not a geologist) but I'm going to have to write about this one.  [A story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4846574.stm) I saw this morning about some bright fellas in Iceland that are drilling down into an active volcano.  The goal is geothermal power of course, as most of Iceland is already run this way today.  I guess the thought is that more is better, hotter is more, deeper is hotter, so deeper is better.  So, they will drill down more than 4 times deeper from where they currently extract 240 degree steam from in order to get even hotter temperatures.  

I don't know much about this process, but I'm thinking that if magma can kill you (and it can) and the rocks are all that stand between you and the magma (and they are), is it wise to drill down through these rocks (it isn't) and thusly create a magma superhighway directly to your homes?  I mean isn't that the exact definition of a volcano?  Magma shooting to the surface through cracks and/or incredibly unwise man-made magma chutes?  Jeez Louise.

Let's just hope they have this all figured out, and their insurance policies cover this sort of thing.
