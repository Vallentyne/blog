Ok.

Looks like the blog has been dormant lately, this happens from time to time.  What's happening out there?  Well, now that we have some recent updates from the man himself, it turns out that Neighbour Jim's actual finish was more accurately somewhere in the top 10.  The problem arose because of a section of the course that got closed due to bad weather, shortly after Jim's team had made it through.  So, Jim's team had to struggle through this stretch while those behind them actually got shuttled around the tough part and restarted ahead of Jim's team!  So, they ended up ranking Jim's team at 11th even though they were only one of 7 teams to complete the entire course.  I'm paraphrasing an email from Jim, but maybe I can convince him to post his own words in a bit...

And in other news, Jordy again won two first place medals in her most recent dance competition!  Quite the record she has going here, really.  We are verry proud of her, and she will soon be finished the dance season for a much needed break.

Home improvements continue, nothing drastic, paint and more paint.  Many many thanks to those of you that have helped us over the last few months with a paint brush, or whatnot.  It really makes a difference, we appreciate it a lot.  The house is starting to look a bit lived in as a result, it's about time.

That's about all for now, I think.
