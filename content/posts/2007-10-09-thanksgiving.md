Nikki and I shared a small prayer last night, I thought I would post it here for your enjoyment.

Dear God, please let Harvey's intestinal crisis come to an end so my very first job upon waking isn't cleaning up feces.Â  Please let Cael's recent streak of not quite making it to the bathroom on time also come to an end so the dirty-laundry train can come to a halt.Â  Finally, please let the punks who frantically rang our back doorbell come back again so I can relive my grandpa fantasy of shining a flashlight on them and yelling ineffectually and shaking a metaphorical stick at them.Â Â  Thanks.

We are very spiritual in our own way.
