Another sunny Friday. How's that sub-basement at work treating you, Court?

I don't buy the argument that Dylan only wrote protest songs to make money. He was writing them when he was nobody, and there's still a strong suggestion of the subversive in his recent work. I think it is just too easy for the critics to criticize whatever makes a person successful. Are the Stones not about sex drugs and rocknroll just because they wrote Angie? Of course not. And Dylan is still about counter-culture in spite of the Band years.
