It seems that the travel gods decided that I have not been pious enough, and have decided to punish me on my trip home from Seattle.Â  Clearly despite the fact that I never ever travel, Nemo decided that I shall spend more hours away from my family than previously expected.Â  As you can imagine, I'm thrilled about the whole thing, and Nikki is too.Â  Newark remains a distant destination for now.Â  Its not all bad of course, I'm currently sitting in a nice little place called RockBottom in Seattle.Â  Not metaphorically (although I am having my 2nd beer), but rather that's the name of the place. Anyway, Seattle is a good place to be.Â  It's about 10 degrees and overcast, which is winter for Seattle, and by all accounts that's pretty much paradise when compared to Ottawa or New York for that matter.Â  Methinks if I ever make it to Newark it will be much different.

Anyway.Â  The inevitable comparisons to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is obvious, just take out the Trains and Automobiles.Â  Planes, Planes and more planes.

Anyway, it was a fantastic week of training, not the least of which was a great party at Safeco Field in Seattle, where they obviously have regular sportsball competitions.Â  It was just too much fun.Â  I snapped a few pics, below.

Good times, now I just need them to end.
