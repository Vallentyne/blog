I think octopi are neat.  I think they are so neat, they scare the living crap out of me.  We have already talked about some of the more [interesting](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/03/to_use_what_may.html) octopus [discoveries](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/09/nifty_octopus_v.html) here in the last three years or so.  They are fascinating creatures, and we will all probably die screaming something like  "Why didn't we ever think 8 arms could do that....".

So, I present the latest [breaking octopus news](http://sympatico.msn.cbc.ca/story/science/national/2006/01/27/octopus060127.html) with great relish.  I guess some of the Cousteau types were playing around with their high-tech underwater robot toy when a giant octopus shows them who's boss and gives them the old one-two-three and then the four-five-six, followed by a stunning seven-eight.  The sub was lucky to get away intact with only a series of severe hickeys.

Oh man, those scientists got so tentacle-smacked, it was an underwater come-uppance of invertebrate proportions.  Sweet.
