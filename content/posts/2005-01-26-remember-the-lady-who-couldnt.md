Remember [the lady who couldn't shut her brain off](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/01/im-little-tired-today-nikki-and-i.htm)?  Well, I guess she's the lucky one, since if we are to believe this report, [this guy](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/21/nine_ten_never_sleep.html) hasn't slept in over 20 years.  He lives in the Ukraine and the doctors there say there's nothing wrong with him, he just can't sleep.  Of course doctors there say there's nothing wrong with vodka and cigarettes for breakfast, but hey.
