There's a certain compulsion when you spend time on the Internet as I do, to post video of cute kittens.Â  I don't agree with it, but it's kind of like dealing with mosquitos when you spend time in the bush, you just ignore it and move on.Â  This is particularly cute though.

Enjoy.Â  Saw it on Boing Boing of course.
