I have [mentioned xkcd before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/08/07/frustration/), it's an absolutely brilliant web comic for nerds. Â This recent comic made me simultaneously inhale coffee deep into my lungs, filling them with warm caffeinated poison at the same time as I emitted twin jets of steaming java from my nose. Â It took several handfuls of paper towels to return my monitors to some semblance of order. Â My keyboard probably won't ever be the same.

I wasn't going to post this to the blog since it's slightly racy but Nikki convinced me that by the time the kids can figure out what's going on in this comic they will probably appreciate the joke. Â That's the plan, anyway and if it backfires I'm blaming her for everything.

Love this guy.

**Update:

Since I am perfectly clairvoyant, have infallible meme radar, coupled with a keen sense of social trends, an article about xkcd [appeared in The Globe and Mail today](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081023.wgtweb24/BNStory/Technology/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081023.wgtweb24).... Â How's that for good blogging? Â Eh? Eh?
