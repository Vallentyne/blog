"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear..."

yeah, my butt.  We`re taking the kids to Toronto tomorrow, and I`m quaking in my boots about it.  Quinn has been having a bit of a time lately with "controlling his temper".  The thought of taking that boy to Canada's Wonderland is a bit like doing origami in a hurricane.  Theoretically possible, but not much fun.  Add to that the fact that we will all be staying in a two-room hotel, and I figure I won't be getting that much sleep this weekend.  Don't get me wrong, I think he'll be fine.  An F5 tornado full of rabid grizzly bears kind of fine.  Time will tell, I guess.

Wish us luck.
