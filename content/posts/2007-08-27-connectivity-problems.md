If you are trying to send any mail to vallentyne.com since Friday or so you will undoubtedly get a delay message, or have it bounce back.  A small problem with our wireless connection since Thursday night's incredible thunderstorm has left us without Internet at home.  With any luck we will be back online soon.

If you really need us, pick up the phone and call, ya freak.
