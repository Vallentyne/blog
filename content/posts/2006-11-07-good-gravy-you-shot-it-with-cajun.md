I'm not a hunter, much to my father-in-law's dismay, but I'm thinking that hunters are going to have a hard time taking this seriously.

It's seasoned shotgun ammo.  You load up, shoot something and leave the ammo inside, where it melts into seasoning in the oven.  The company looks like it's just starting up, but they are promising several flavours coming soon.   Check out the [company website](http://www.seasonshot.com) and judge for yourself if this is for real or not.
Even though the execution of the idea (how did you like that pun?) is good, do we really need this thing?  Does this sound completely ridiculous to anyone else, or is it just me?

I saw this on the Wired Blog, [Table of Malcontents](http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2006/11/teriyaki_shotgu.html).
