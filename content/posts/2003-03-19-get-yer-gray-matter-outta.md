Get yer gray matter outta the gutter, Gibson! I'll have you know that my "miscellaneous" 15% consists of volunteering at a soup kitchen here downtown...OK, would you believe that I walk little old ladies and children across busy Elgin street? Alright, alright,  I hand out coupons for alternative theatre at the Bare Fax! Sheesh. Like you all haven't done THAT before. It's NOTHING compared to what Court used to do at the funeral home! Sure he looks all innocent, but...WOW....he ain't! Nooo sirreee BOB!
