I know it's wrong, don't tell me that.  I find this funny, maybe I'm broken, so what?  It's too late anyway, I have already procreated.

A link to what I'm told is a pediatric centre in Arlington, Virginia.  It may very well be a hoax, but oh my the logo is funny.

Once again, props to Boing Boing, and I guess they found it somewhere else originally.
