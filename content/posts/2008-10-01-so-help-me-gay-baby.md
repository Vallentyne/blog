Just read an interview with two of my favourite news anchors, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Â It's typically hilarious, and incisive and it makes some typically good points about the US financial crisis, the presidential election campaign especially.


<blockquote>**STEPHEN COLBERT:**Â One of the things I love about my character is I can make vast declarations and it doesn't matter if I'm wrong. I love being wrong. So my character can tell you exactly what's going to happen: The Democrats are going to change everything. We're going to have gay parents marrying their own gay babies. Obama's gonna be sworn in on a gay baby. The oath is gonna end ''So help me, gay baby.''Â 
**STEWART:**Â Then they'll head right over to the abortion mixer. There'll be a dance, and then there'll be a little tent set up outside, just in case anybody wants an [RU-486](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone).Â </blockquote>
