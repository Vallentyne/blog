So.  Here I am.  T-3 to our 2nd Wedding Anniversary.  I am keeping Nikki primed with little teaser comments about what I got for her.  I made reservations for Saturday night, the brats will be staying at Paul and Darlene's along with the dog.  All is well with the world.  Or is it?

Whammo!

Jordy has chicken pox all over her body.  The boy is doomed to get them too.  The whole romantic getaway is in jeopardy.  Why oh why is that cosmic timing so darn good?  It's really sick.  Sigh.

I know that there are more [important things](http://www.canoe.ca/Slam030227/nhl_ott-cp.html) in the world than this.  I know that.  You don't need to tell me that.  It's just that of all weekends the timing here is the rottenest timing that ever rotted a rot.

Damn those chicken pox!

Later.
