I'm not sure what side these octopus guys are working on, but I must say that the video is worth installing that evil evil RealPlayer for.  Whatever you do, don't let RealPlayer steal all of your file associations.  I really hate those guys.

But I digress.

The octopus in this video isn't nearly as lovable as [the last one I mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/03/to_use_what_may.html), in fact he's big and rather bloodthirsty.  However, it seems that he is on our side this time, since [he takes on a shark](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/octopus/media_players_blue/shark_hi.html).  It's incredible.

It's kind of weird to notice that I have mentioned octopi two different times already.  You may read more into that than I actually am prepared to admit.  I mean just because there are two separate octopus stories here doesn't mean that I think they are our evil tentacled masters lying in the deep.  Not at all.  And the resemblance to the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/08/heathen_like_me.html) is purely coincidental.  I don't actually think that octopi are the FSM equivalent of devils or anything.  Not at all.  That's purely a hypothesis, really.

Ramen.
