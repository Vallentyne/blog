I whole-heartedly agree with Court on this...maybe it's because I'm a guy and biologically prone to violence, but those dogs would either be dead or in a world of hurt right now....and so would the owner. There is no way I'd be letting him away with that. IN FACT, I suggest we go pay him a visit and perhaps make slippers outta his rodent mutts! I've been attacked twice by large dogs (black lab, and a german sheppard), not to mention Cindy's ordeal with a doberman as a child, so I have very little tolerance for owners of dogs who bite. Of course, that's anger talking, but I'd have called the police at the very least.
