Recently Nikki put a new ring-tone on her phone which has been invading our brains regularly (every time she gets a Facebook notification, actually).Â  It's "Always look on the bright side of life" from [Monty Python's Life of Brian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian).Â  It fits right into our personal life philosophy of "find the happy, it's there if you look" that we are trying to impart on the kids.Â  It's not empty optimism really, but rather that a positive outlook usually helps in every situation, no matter how bleak.Â  Nobody wants to hear you bitch, nobody cares if you aren't actively fixing the problem, so get up and get to work.Â  Working on a problem feels good, if you feel good you smile, and things get better. It's that simple.

Anyway, we were trying to explain where this song came from to Jordy, and we ended up watching this together last night.

Which led to this:

Epic comedy, brilliant, timeless and silly.Â  It makes me happy, which in turn makes it easier to always look on the bright side.Â  Go get yourself some happy, dammit.
