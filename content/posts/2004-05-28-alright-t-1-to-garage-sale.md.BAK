Alright, T-1 to Garage sale day.  Signs are posted, newspaper ad comes out today, items are still being priced at an ever more feverish pace, tables prepared, children's lunch menu decided, nap times planned, totes arranged and rearranged.

It's crazy business, people.

The main consensus is that it's a royal pain in the butt and we will all be glad when it's over.  Nikki most of all, since she did the most of the work.  I told her she deserved to take the proceeds from the garage sale and go to the spa to pamper herself.  It wasn't met with absolute resistance, but she's not sold on the idea yet.

We'll see how it goes.
