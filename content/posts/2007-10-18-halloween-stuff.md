Some Halloween links for you today.Â  First off we have a mask that will make anyone pee themselves.

Jeezus H. Christ on a hockey stick, this is one scary assed Halloween mask!Â  It's sick, wrong, creepy, horrifying and somehow mesmerizing at the same time.

I saw it on [Boing Boing](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/171646909/creepy-michael-jacks.html).

Also a cool Halloween trick is this tutorial on how to bleed realistically when "cut" with a knife.Â  It requires a bit of chemistry, but it [looks pretty good in action](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/835982/how_to_make_blood_appear_in_body_without_any_wound/).

Saw that on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2007/10/14/fake-blood-out-of-nowhere/).

I'm sure there will be more good Halloween stuff to come.
