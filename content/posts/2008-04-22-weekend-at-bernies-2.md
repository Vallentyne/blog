If you recall, I mentioned a news story a little while back about [2 chuckleheads](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/11/einsteins-try-to-cash-dead-buddys-cheque/) that tried to cash their dead friend's social security cheque. Well this is a news story that just keeps on giving.Â  In [a true Hollywood happy ending](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/04/22/5358021-ap.html), they have been cleared of all charges in the matter.Â  Apparently the crux of their defense was simple:Â  they claim that their sick friend was actually alive when they plunked his butt into a chair and rolled him down the street.Â  He must have expired en route, they claim.

The prosecutor was unable to prove the time of death beyond a reasonable doubt, and they walked.

That's just golden.
