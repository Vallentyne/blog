Wel.

That was random alright.  I wil certainly wonder if I should have invited you along for the blog party but only if you wil forgive me for apparently mis-speling your name for about 6 years.  How did I not know that it is Alison, and not Allison?  One "L", not two.  Ahem.  Way to go, me.  That's a real friend for ya.  What's stranger is the fact that nobody noticed or corrected me al this time.  Why is that?

Apologeticaly yours.
