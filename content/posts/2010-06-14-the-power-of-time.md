I thoroughly enjoyed this little talk about how you perceive time, how cultures and countries tend to perceive time, and how it affects everything. Â Fascinating stuff, and the animations make it really pretty cool too.

It makes me want to hear a bit more, it sounds like an excerpt from a longer talk, or multiple lectures. Â Very cool stuff.
