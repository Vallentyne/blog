I saw an article (it's literally all over the web now) about a [fake bus stop](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2069467/Wayward-Alzheimer%27s-patients-foiled-by-fake-bus-stop.html) outside a senior's home that acts like a honey pot and "traps" wayward seniors who wander outside and try to go home.Â  The bus stop looks real, but the bus doesn't stop there.Â  The seniors don't know that, and wait patiently.Â  This gives the staff the opportunity to go out and gently lead them back inside.Â  The beauty of Alzheimer's is that trick will probably work again tomorrow.

I must say that on one side that sounds kind of mean, but then again it probably saves the lives of these people, otherwise wandering away into the winter night.

I can only hope somebody does the same for me when I am older.Â  Maybe a fake beer keg on the sidewalk, luring me over, trying to pump some 50 out of it.Â  Or probably even an arcade might work, retro gaming machines beckoning to my newly adolescent-again mind.Â  The staff could wait until I was out of quarters and then lead me back to my room with the surety that I would almost certainly attempt to escape again in the morning.Â  All they need to do is make sure I have a pocket full of quarters when I wake up.Â  Another probable successful trap would be a few shiny gadgets, and laptops sitting on a bench by the door.

Perfect security.
