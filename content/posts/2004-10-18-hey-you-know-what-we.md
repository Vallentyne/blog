Hey, you know what?  We have Jordy's Birthday party this weekend, it should be a blast.   It's at Michaels', the craft store.  She and Nikki are the crafty types, you know.  One thing I will be doing before they leave is going over the party supplies to make sure we aren't in copyright violation for using the words "Happy Birthday"(tm).  Yes, apparently somebody has copyrighted those words.  Here's [the link](http://techdirt.com/articles/20041017/2211232.shtml)

Strange stuff.  I had already heard that the song "Happy Birthday" was copyrighted, which is why you never hear anyone at Jack Astor's sing it.

So, let start using another phrase to avoid paying any fines or royalties.  How about
"Joyous Date of Birth, Jordy", or "Good Annual Celebration of your Birth".  Just doesn't have the same ring, eh?  Damn those guys for being quicker than I am.
