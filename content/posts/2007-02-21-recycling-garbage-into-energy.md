I saw a very cool article the other day about how a process exists to basically vaporize garbage into atoms, with the byproducts a molten-glass slurry and a gas that be used to produce hydrogen.  In other words, it's one of those things that sounds too good to be true.  Anyway, if it does turn out that it's reasonable it would change the world.Â  Landfills would produce energy and cities wouldn't have garbage problems anymore.Â  It's definitely a great dream, if it works.Â  [Check it out](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/science/873aae7bf86c0110vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html).

[Wilson](http://robertwilsonphoto.com/) and [Angie](http://angied.wordpress.com/) should be happy with it, anyway.
