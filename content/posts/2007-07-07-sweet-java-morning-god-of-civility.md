Oh, coffee.  How do I love thee?  Even robbed of caffeine, your sway over me is absolute.   Nikki and I worship at coffee's steaming altar every day with glee.  Don't underestimate the power of coffee, it really is the only thing that makes the kids cute again when they wake you up too early....

You would be hard pressed to find a more loving tribute to coffee than this set of shots, the absolute edge of when cream hits coffee, little creamy umbrellas.  Very cool, and just looking at it makes me want a cup now.
