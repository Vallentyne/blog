Hey! I just drove the hearse...and that's not a metaphor for ANYTHING!!! Court did live with Tim who was the self-proclaimed Grand Pooba of certain unsavory activities at the funeral home. They tried to recruit me, but I'm not into that whole necrophelia movement. I heard that Gary was one of the first to join their little cabal. I heard the initiation was...well...icky. 




Good call on this Blogger thing, Court. It's fun!
