](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/CrushLuther1_SM.jpg)Completely forgot to pimp this beforehand on the blog (mostly because I am still unemployed, and don't get to sit at a computer all day as much), but we had Crush Luther play at our house on Saturday, and it was freaking amazing. Â We had a pretty good turn out, and I think everyone had a stupendous time. Â A living room (well, dining room in our case) setting is an absolutely awesome way to experience Crush Luther. Â The vibe was relaxed, fun, and unintentionally hilarious when Lloyd realized that we applauded at the end of every song, it was a perfect time to wander in and gob on the band. Â I think he might have accidentally interrupted at least the first two songs until he figured out we all weren't going to tolerate that. Â Luther in particular was pretty cool about the whole thing, since he took the most, ah, saliva.

Anyway, there were some Facebook videos and pics taken and posted as the night went on, but thankfully we had Mr. Wilson there to show us how it's all done. Â I strongly suggest you head on over and check out the rest of these fine pics, and tell him I sent ya.
