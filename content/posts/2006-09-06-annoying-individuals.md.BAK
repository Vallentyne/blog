We all know them.  People who, either through ignorance or on purpose, bother the living crap out of everybody around them.  Sometimes there's just no explaining their behaviour, they aren't sick or broken, they are just purposefully bothersome to everyone around them.  Most times they can't seem to help it, no matter what the consequences are.  They could be risking everything and still they persist.  Why?

I don't know the whole answer, but clearly it is not just humans that have the market cornered on annoying self destructive behaviour.  How else can you explain this [moronic monkey](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=8811551493740102634)?Â  I mean, that is not wise behaviour, on any level.Â  It's funny as hell, but certainly not wise.
