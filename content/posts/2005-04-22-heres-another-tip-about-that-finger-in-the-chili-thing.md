We've [mentioned this before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/03/ah_food_it_seem.html)...

Once again, thanks to Boing Boing for this tip, it's [another good point](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/business/22cnd-wendys.html?ex=1271822400&en=29a4aaccbe8668ac&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) on that finger in the chili incident.  It's no surprise that Wendy's scrambled a whole team of people to keep the spin happening on this and to try to put the whole thing to bed.  The article goes into deep detail on how much this story has hurt Wendy's business, (oh, I'm sorry about this one) cutting it by double digits.

Will I never get tired of those finger puns?  I'm not even that good at them...
