I guess he's "lucky".

This guy thought he had a toothache, but actually he had a nailgun backfire, 6 days earlier and they ended up pulling a 4 inch construction nail out of his skull.

[Ouch](http://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2005-01-16-nail-skull_x.htm)

How the heck did you not notice that?  That thing must have hit him pretty hard, even if he somehow missed the PAIN of it all, the shock should have been like getting hit with a baseball bat, to my thinking.
