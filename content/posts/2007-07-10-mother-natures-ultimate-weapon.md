Jesus H. You-Know-Who on a hockey stick, that's a scary assed dog.  A Schwarzen-whippet.

Apparently it's because of a genetic condition, and the dog is really [very gentle and cuddly](http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?id=67f15c17-2717-4022-bb76-1b982456e793&k=94653).  Suuure buddy.  She chews rebar for fun and lives in a concrete doghouse.  Anyway, that's a nice doggy, good doggy.
