Ethanol IS a better product than petroleum based fuels. However, it doesn't do so well in cold weather. That's why the ethanol fuel you see here is mixed with regular gas at an 85:15 ratio (ethanol to fuel)...at least I think that's the ratio. Still good, but not perfect. In fact, a local Ottawa company (Iogen) is working on perfecting the whole Canadian ethanol thing.
