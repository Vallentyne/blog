Time for a roundup of strange natural happenings, and of course adorable animals.



	  * [WTF Nature](http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_nature) is a good overall resource for strange natural things, lots of contributors.


	  * Mom provided a good link to [a video from the TED conference](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/206%C2%A0) where they show just how really really strange and wonderful creatures octopi really are, among other cool underwater things.Â  Definitely worth a watch.
	  * Then we have a nice few shots of a family enjoying a newly built playstructure.Â  [A family of bears](http://www.tcnj.edu/~hofmann/playground/Playground.htm), that is.Â  The perils of building anything that fun when living in Alaska, I suppose.
	  * [Biiig freaking cow, huge, really really big cow.Â  Very Large Cow.

	  * [Insanely cute animal pictures](http://internet-pets.blogspot.com/2008/05/mothers-love.html).Â  Hurts my teeth to look at this.
	  * Extraordinarily specialized blog, narrowly covering the specific [cuteness of otters](http://cuteotters.com/), which really is an under-reported field.Â  Bravo.
	  * Finally, only narrowly animal related, a blog covering things that look like ducks.Â  [Yes, really](http://www.thispeanutlookslikeaduck.com/quack/).

So there you have it.Â  All of your natural wonders covered here in excruciating detail.
