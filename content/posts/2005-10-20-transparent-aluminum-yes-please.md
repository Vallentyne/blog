The US Air Force is [now testing](http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123012131) a new kind of material designed to replace "traditional multi-layered glass transparencies" in military speak, or "the de-bug-ulator" in normal speak.  It's lighter, stronger and outperforms bulletproof glass easily.  Essentially, in my scientific opinion, it's transparent aluminum, but some pointdexter will probably point out it isn't just aluminum, it's a ceramic compound, and get all technical on me.  It's still way cool, I don't care.

I can't wait until we can get other transparent aluminum products.  Like siding for my house.  That would be neat, although you know what they say about people who live in bulletproof glass houses; Those guys are really fricking annoying, always throwing stones and stuff.

Or how about a transparent step ladder?  Talk about freaking people out, but would you still get bad luck from walking under it?

Ultimately, I guess you could finally make one of those lame-assed Wonder Woman invisible airplanes, where all you see are the people sitting in midair, flying along.  What is the point of that thing?

On that note, Wonder Woman had the worst stuff, really a classic case of gender discrimination.  I mean really.  She's super, but all she gets is that lame "truth lasso" and bulletproof jewelry?  Still, it seems that the best-known Wonder Woman from TV is not necessarily [true to the creator's vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman).  Shocker.
