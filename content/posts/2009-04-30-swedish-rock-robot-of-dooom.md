A robot technician with apparently a rather rock-shaped head was [almost the most recent casualty](http://www.thelocal.se/19120.html) in the (slow to start but terrifying in it's inevitability) human-robot war.Â  It seems that a Swedish factory was using robots to move head-shaped rocks to and fro for some strange reason unclear in the article.Â  A tech thought he had turned the power off to the robot to service it, but in a moment worthy of the climax of a movie, the robot moved (DUNH DUNH DUNH DUUUUNH! - that's how you type dramatic scary music sounds) and grabbed Rocky the Technician's head, apparently thinking that it was a rock, and wouldn't let go.Â  Since he didn't have a gun, grenade, or any other weapon of glamorized movie violence he just managed to escape from the homicidal robot with his life, if not his ribs (why did he break his ribs if the robot had him by the head?), intact.Â  Whoa, Dude.Â  It seems that the thing to do when you are hurt at work when you aren't following any kind of common sense or safety procedures is to sue your employer, and that's just what Rocky's doing.

If there was any movie justice in the real world, a much more satisfying conclusion would be for Rocky and the Robot to go a few rounds and settle the matter once and for all, ending only with the utter destruction of one or the other.Â  That would be awesome. Instead, we all know that the robot was returned to service and life at the plant went back to normal, humans and Robot working side by side.Â  Or is Robot just patiently biding it's time, waiting with inhuman patience for the next victim with rocks in his head to get a little too close.... DUNH DUNH DUNH DUUUUNH!

P.S. No robots were harmed during the writing of this post.

P.P.S.Â  By the way, Swedish Rock Robot of DOOOM is the very best band name I have come up with since [Rubber Truck Nut Lover](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/01/17/aw-nuts/).
