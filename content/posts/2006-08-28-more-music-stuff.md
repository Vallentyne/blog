Another music themed post, this time a [Wired piece](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.09/pitchfork.html) on [Pitchfork Media](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/), which is a grass-roots music review site.Â  It's a good piece and not the first time I have read something about these guys.Â  It's neat because they review the completely unheard of indie-type bands.Â  They are also incredibly influential (within their sphere of readership), in that a good review from them can launch obscure bands to prominence.Â  They are doing the "Rolling Stone" thing except they actually seem to review music.Â  It's pretty neat and a good article about how music is becoming niche-ier.

Think of the Pitchfork Media site as a long head to head chat with Noonan over 3 beers in the corner of a pub, you've got the idea.
