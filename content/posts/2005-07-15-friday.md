This is what happens when Nikki is coming to pick me up on a Friday afternoon from work.  I spend the time vapidly posting to this ridiculous blog any old damn thing that comes into my head.  Pretty much like all the other time I spend posting, except that now I have even more time to really write about nothing, whereas usually I don't have much time, so the content gets a little more filtered and boiled down to the essentials.  So, it kind of sucks to be you, if you find yourself reading this.

By the way Kyle, your particular [attention](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/07/holy_body_groom.html#comments) to the post about [body grooming](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/07/holy_body_groom.html) was noted, and I will consider myself informed.  And besides now I know what to get Rachel for Christmas; something she may want to use to make the fence post look bigger.
