Well, time sure flies when you are having fun.  I don't know where the days go sometimes.  A busy family and fun weekends with great friends sure makes the time soar.

So, what sort of updates are there for the Vallentyne family, in the last 6 days, you may ask?  So far Cael, thankfully, stopped gaining 2 lbs a week.  He is still off the charts, but at least he's not 20lbs or anything.  He's just a modest 15.5lbs at 2 months old.  Yeesh!  Sometimes I have Quinn on one hip, and Cael in his carrier on the other.  Nothing like 45+lbs to give you an upper body work out.

Quinn is presently identifying letters of the alphabet.  He has most of them down.  It may take a trained ear however, to decipher what he is saying on occasion.  All in all though he's pretty clear for a near 22 month old.  Quinn is also counting to five now, and he's identifying different means of transportation.  He can tell you a bike from a boat, and a truck from a tractor, that sort of thing. I'll tell you though, nothing beats watching/listening to him sing the "Goodbye, Goodbye" song from "Bear in the Big Blue House".  Just precious.

Jordy is over the big devastation of last week and moved on.  It was a really short lived sadness, thankfully.  She has decided to take Karate camp this March break.  I will have to sacrifice all that free mommy/daughter time with her, but we'll make up for it in the evening.  It will be great not having to contend with homework which hinders the quality time that is barely left over for the fun stuff.  I'm thinking a movie or something is in our future.  Besides, what better skill to learn that Karate?  It will be good to give her that kick start in self defense.  Rumour has it she can earn her black stripe on the white belt this March Break.  I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for her.

As for Court and I, well, what can I say.  We are back in the "social saddle" so to speak.  Thanks to Mom and Dad we were able to get out for an evening to celebrate 3 awesome years together.  Thanks mom & dad!!!!!!!!!!!  You guys rock!  Thank you also Jim, for hosting us both next door from 11:00 PM onwards.  We were back home in time for Cael's 5 AM feeding, but only just.  We were surprisingly ok the next day too.  Imagine.  I look forward to returning the favour maybe on the 19th!  You can feel free to drink as much of our CR as you like.  It's owed to you.  Thanks also to Kyle, Ali, Cindy & Robbi who left a rocking good time at O'Connor's just because we couldn't get in.  (We didn't have our ID with us).  We had a wicked time hanging out will all of you, and I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sad that we didn't make the early morning soak in the hot tub with you crazies.  Ah, Good times, good times.

Well Mundane Ramblings indeed.  I'm going to toddle off now.  Jordy is just getting out of the shower and will want that long mane of hers braided for Brownies no doubt.

Cheers,
Nik
