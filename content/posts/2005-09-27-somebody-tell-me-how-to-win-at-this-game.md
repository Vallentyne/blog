...before I pluck my own eyes out with my thumbs.  This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen, why can't I win at this [dumb game](http://www.eyezmaze.com/grow/RPG/index.html)?  Actually it's not that dumb at all, it's fascinating.  I have things worked out so I can get "max"ed out on 7 out of 8 objects, but why won't the rocks level up?  Why?  Why?

Yes, I was a little bored at work on Friday.
