If you don't want to ruin the good mood of an excellent sunny warm Spring Friday, then move along and don't click on this link.Â  I tend to stay away from posting about controversial stuff here, but the terrible shootings at Virginia Tech have flushed out the crazies and I can't ignore this.

It's part of a point-counterpoint piece on CNN about gun ownership in the US. Â  [This is the pro-gun part](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/19/commentary.nugent/index.html?eref=rss_topstories), written by the dangerous moron Ted Nugent.Â  This piece does nothing to prove that his points are valid, but it does give me a little shiver thinking about what kind of world he wants to live in.Â  It seems that he is happiest imagining a hail of gunfire in almost every circumstance in life.Â  I particularly think the pictures they used are appropriate:Â  the left anti-gun writer is a former editor of the New York Times who looks like an intellectual (albeit a fairly eccentric one), while Ted is pictured in camo wearing a shit eating grin and shades.Â  You can just imagine him wiping the Budweiser suds from his lip with one hand with his smoking AK-47 balanced in his other.Â  It makes me feel somewhat better that he is the best the pro-gun lobby has and they have no moderate, educated voice.Â  The only part that makes me worry is maybe the pro-gun lobby picked him **on purpose** because he might be more appealing to their core members than a moderate intellectual.

Man, it's really hard to not just shake you head and be darn glad that you live in Canada.Â  Does anybody really really need to carry a gun with them everywhere they go in the hopes of trading some hot lead with the next guy trying to cut you off on the Queensway?Â  I think that most Canadians (and hopefully most Americans) would answer No.
