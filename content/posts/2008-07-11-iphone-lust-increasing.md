Huh, I thought I was all over that, but now that the release of the [iPhone](http://apple.com/ca/iphone) in Canada is [here](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2008/07/11/6129606-cp.html), my interest has increased again.Â  Mostly because I can use Activesync with the Exchange server at home and get all of my email right on the thing.Â  Gotta love that.

Definite downside is the cost, even with Roger's recent caving to pressure for a lower rate.Â  It could be a lot of [money per month](http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wireless-products/iphone_voice_data_packages)....
