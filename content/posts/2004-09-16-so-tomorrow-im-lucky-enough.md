So, tomorrow I'm lucky enough to get to go see the Barstool Prophets play.  It's part of the week-long birthday festivities I seem to be enjoying.  The Barstool Prophets don't technically exist anymore, but they're playing a gig for some reason this Friday.  A visit to [barstoolprophets.com](http://www.barstoolprophets.com) doesn't reveal much beyond the date.  The last info up there is just a long post about the band's breakup in June 2002.

In any case, I'm pumped about it, they are awesome.  and rad.  and cool.  gnarly.

Dammit, I'm too old to use words like that.
