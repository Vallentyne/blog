In case you haven't noticed, I just sold out officially.  The blog is now what they call "ad supported".  Not only are you few faithful readers subjected to pitiful prose and watered down sarcasm courtesy of me, you are now also subjected to the bane of internet browsing: banner ads.  This is now my new revenue model given my impending unemploymentedness, so you will have to just bear with it, I'm afraid.  The family has to eat, and Mamma didn't raise no fool.  So, feast your eyeballs on that ad-related goodness and feel good that your annoyance is lining my pockets with hundred and thousands of fractions of pennies!  I'm rolling around (naked) in a tidal wave of decimal places...mwahahahahah!

ok, got a little carried away.
