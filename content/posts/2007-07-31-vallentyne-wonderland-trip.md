Well, the Vallentyne family trip to Wonderland was a success and we are back in one piece.

At first glance, it seemed like a recipe for disaster.Â  We were heading for Toronto with 3 kids in the van, we didn't leave on time (shocker there for us Vallentynes, I know) and I almost forgot the Wonderland tickets.Â  Anyway, despite that we had a great time, the trip was fine and the kids had a blast.Â  I haven't grabbed the pictures yet to put up here, but trust me when I say the kids were tired and happy.Â  Jordy and I went on some of the "big kid" rides together, including one at the waterpark which was the winner for all of us.Â  I can't remember what it was called, something to do with "Barracuda" but the gist of it is that you are a turd being flushed down a humungous toilet.Â  You'll have to take my word that this is much more fun than it sounds, even Nikki enjoyed it and she is not so kicked on rides.Â  I think her comment was that she felt safe on it, despite the obvious speed and the impending threat of drowning.Â  Here's hoping I never completely figure her out, it's more fun that way.

Also, big kudos to Nanny for achieving the impossible:Â  Cael is now potty trained.Â  Yep, I'm not to proud to say that he defeated me completely.Â  He actively resisted that for way longer than I thought possible, but Nanny beat him.Â  Not literally, I don't think, although that would explain how she did it so quickly....Â  I kid, I kid.

So there you go folks, a little update on the family Vallentyne for ya.
