This is a quick one, but man I have to say, take 3 minutes and give this a listen.Â  It's the isolated vocal track of David Lee Roth doing [Running with the Devil](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2008/01/david-lee-roth.html).Â 

It's funny at first when you hear his little squawks out of context of the music, but I have to hand it to the guy, he sounds pretty darn good for completely unaccompanied.Â  It's better than I would have imagined, for sure.Â  I always wonder just how much studio "magic assistance" artists get, but from this it's pretty clear there's not much they have done for him.Â  Although I guess this could be the cleaned-up vocal track.... Anyway, it's neato.Â  Go and have a listen.

Â Saw it on [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/68628/Didnt-Todd-Rundgren-try-this).
