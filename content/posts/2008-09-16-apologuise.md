The Urban Dictionary: [Apologuise](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Apologuise)


<blockquote>An apology given when you don't feel you did anything wrong so it will end an argument.</blockquote>


This seemed particularly significant in light of the [previous post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/09/16/church-of-england-apologises-to-darwin/).
