Wired has a great article on it's GeekDad blog about plot holes in movies that I will admit I have at least thought about at one time or another.Â  Some examples that come to mind are the several Star Wars related plot holes they cover.Â  I'm not sure if my inherent geekiness forces me to over think these things, but for whatever reason I am able to enjoy most of these movies, despite their somewhat obvious problems with logic.Â  If you think about them too much these logic holes can become hard to ignore, though.Â  I remember being quite bothered by the Gremlins logic problem, it made no sense at all why all of the cute little mogwais weren't already gremlins, they must have eaten something at some point...

Anyway, there you go, [have a read](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/09/top-10-unanswered-questions-in-geeky-movies/) and see if you noticed any of these.
