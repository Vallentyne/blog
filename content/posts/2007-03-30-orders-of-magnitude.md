I have lots of work to do, and no time to do it in.Â  But for the last 15 minutes I have been scrolling the mouse wheel back and forth on this web site.Â  I saw this on Metafilter and it's fascinating.Â  The idea is to give you some idea of the relative size of objects, from an electron all the way up to the estimated size of the universe.Â  It's so cool.Â  Click on some of the things to get a brief description.

It's on the Nikon camera website and it's called [Universcale](http://www.nikon.co.jp/main/eng/feelnikon/discovery/universcale/index.htm). Man that's a cool webpage.

Enjoy.
