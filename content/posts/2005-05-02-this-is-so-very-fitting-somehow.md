Late to the posting party I am, too busy busy busy.

But, that means instead of posting just any old drivel because I have the time, I can pick just the good stuff.  Or slightly better than the normal stuff.  Anyway, you be the judge.

Apparently The White House was elevated to the highest level of alert on Friday due to a fast moving airborne object.  Yep, they moved the Dubya to the super duper secret bunker underneath The White House and the whole place was crawling with armed folks.  They dispatched a Black Hawk helicopter to go and challenge the object, and raised the anti-aircraft guns on the roof of the White House to prepare to fire.  The only problem was, it was an itty bitty rain cloud.  Yes, Chicken Little, [the sky is falling](http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1472905,00.html?=rss).

Only Dubya, let me tell you.
