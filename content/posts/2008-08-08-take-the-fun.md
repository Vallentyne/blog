Cael has of late been getting a little more philosophical in his views on waiting and patience.Â  This is a huge change for a 4 year old who until recently could become impatient in mid-jump waiting to hit the ground again.Â  His new zen-like state of existence can best be summed up by his recent thoughts on driving to Arnprior:

"Mom, I don't take the drive, I just take the fun."

Now if that kid doesn't have it figured out, I don't know who does.
