In the words of my wise father, "Laziness is the mother of invention."  For that, I salute him.

The daunting task of cleaning the cheese from that wretched _"electric"_ fondue pot stared me in the face until 5 PM on Sunday.  I thought I had put it in the dishwasher before, but could not be certain.  At last I decided to tackle it, and when I turned that blessed thing over, stamped clearly on the bottom was COMPLETELY IMMERSIBLE.  Two beautiful words sitting side by side.  The manual had two other beautiful words, side by side... DISHWASHER SAFE. Whoever decided to invent my _"electric"_ fondue pot, and make it completely safe to immerse in water, AND dishwasher safe, is a genius.  Allow me to shout it from the rooftops - A GENIUS!

At last technology has made it so you can put almost anything in the dishwasher and forget about it.  Someday they will invent one that allows me to sit all three kids in there on the gentle cycle.  I'll come back an hour later and they will be gleaming, and dry!  Teeth sparkling and all!  Beautiful.

That's all for now.  I'm sure I will have another tip on how to prevent exerting yourself too much, soon.

PS - Thanks for coming on Saturday everyone.  Seeing how clean up was so easy, Lets do it again soon!
