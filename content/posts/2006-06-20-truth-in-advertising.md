Seldom has a commercial been so very very bang on in nailing that element of truthfulness to a situation, and more or less being honest about how people use their products.

Enter [Folgers "Happy Mornings"](http://www.boardsmag.com/screeningroom/commercials/2971/), which is basically a drug flashback you have after a very busy night.  This thing is trippy, to say the least.  It makes me laugh because Nik and I have had more of these mornings than either of us can remember.  No sleep and young children really make it add up some mornings.  Oh, like, say this morning.  And yesterday morning.  And the one before that.

The kicker is we both quit caffeine a few months ago, but I'll be damned if I can give up the coffee.  Oh well.

Enjoy the show.
