P90X dude Steve Edwards posts [a nice bit about the salt lobby](http://steve-edwards.blogspot.com/2010/06/salt-empire-strikes-back.html) that is resisting changes to recent efforts to reduce the amount of salt we consume daily, which as it turns out is probably a staggering amount for most of us.

The best part is his language about how most processed foods are really food at all:


<blockquote>Most processed foods arenâ€™t really food. Theyâ€™re just amalgamations of chemicals that bind together that are flavored in a way that some scientists have figured out will cause you to crave them. For example:

[_As a demonstration, Kellogg prepared some of its biggest sellers with most of the salt removed. The Cheez-It fell apart in surprising ways. The golden yellow hue faded. The crackers became sticky when chewed, and the mash packed onto the teeth. The taste was not merely bland but medicinal.

â€œI really get the bitter on that,â€ the companyâ€™s spokeswoman, J. Adaire Putnam, said with a wince as she watched Mr. Kepplinger struggle to swallow.

They moved on to Corn Flakes. Without salt the cereal tasted metallic. The Eggo waffles evoked stale straw. The butter flavor in the Keebler Light Buttery Crackers, which have no actual butter, simply disappeared. _](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/health/30salt.html?src=me&ref=homepage)

The main addictive qualities of these foods come from salt, sugar, and fat; incidentally (or not) the three culprits of the obesity epidemic. Thereâ€™s not much nutrition in these foods, which are fortified with a few â€œessential vitamins.â€ This may sound great on TV to kids but is done, essentially, to keep you from dying quickly. Real food has all the vitamins, minerals, macronutrients, micronutrients, and phytonutrients you need to be healthy and doesnâ€™t need to be fortified with anything.</blockquote>


It's nice to see that in writing. Â Essential vitamins, which just barely prevent you from dying from eating this stuff. Â Makes you think, doesn't it?

I wonder how much salt I eat? Â Hm, pass the chips while I think on that.
