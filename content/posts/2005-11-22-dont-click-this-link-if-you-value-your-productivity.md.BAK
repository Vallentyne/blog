Why did I do it?  Oh why?  I was working away happily before this damn thing came along.  Now I'm guiltily clicking away instead of working.  I had to close the thing down before I get fired.

So, don't click the link, ok?  Alright, I know you will click it anyway, so here's the gist of it.  You are to defend your fort by shooting the little stick men before they knock down your wall.

Key information that you need to have (which can be found by reading the help, but is more fun the first time if you know this already going in):

1. The spacebar reloads.
2. It gets way way harder.

Kiss your afternoon goodbye.
