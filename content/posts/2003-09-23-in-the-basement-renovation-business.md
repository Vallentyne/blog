In the basement renovation business, there's crazy and then there's just [plain stupid](http://http://www.axemusic.com/services/custom_installations/home_theatre/dream_home.htm).

I'm torn between the immediate need for a finished playroom and the future need (ok, want) for a home theatre.  How much should I prepare for now, knowing I don't currently have home theatre gear, nor the money to buy it?  There's a lot here to worry about.

Sigh.

This is just the beginning of a death spiral of decisions that I will have to try to make and just end up not making at all.  Just you watch.

On a sadder note, Art Carlson of WKRP [died yesterday](http://www.canoe.ca/Television/sep23_jump-ap.html).  That was a really funny guy.
