It feels sometimes like modern science is getting a little carried away with it's own success.Â  Often medical science is amazing, and any breakthroughs that save a person's life are of course welcome, but at times these things read like the most ridiculous playground bragging.

I give you this: [surgeons remove healthy kidney through vagina](http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/03/kidney.vagina.surgery/index.html).

Was that completely necessary?Â  I mean really.Â  It sounds like that surgeon made a bet with his buddies and had to go through with it.Â  I'm not all that convinced that in this particular case it was the very best decision for everyone.Â  If you notice in the following picture, everyone is smiling, except the lady in green.Â  Guess who had an organ removed from her vagina?Â  I rest my case.
