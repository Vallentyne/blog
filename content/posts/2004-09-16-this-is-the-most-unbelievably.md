This is the most unbelievably disgusting thing I have ever heard.

It's [Maggot debridement therapy](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/16/maggot_bandaid.html), or basically the medical use of sterilized maggots on open wounds.  From the link on Boing Boing:


<blockquote>The larvae preferentially consume dead tissue (steering clear of live), they excrete an antibacterial agent, and they stimulate wound healing.</blockquote>


I think I can speak for everyone when I say: yeeech!
