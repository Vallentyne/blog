I am realizing lately that I am auditioning to become a certain variety of old person. Â I haven't got the part yet, but let's just say I have received a call back. Â I'm going to be a geek, certainly, but my particular flavour of old geek is one that enjoys music and radio a lot, as much as or more than I always did as a normal person.

The old geek I will become recently discovered he likes [podcasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast). Â If you don't know what that is, it's basically free radio episodes you download over the Internet. Â Most people use an app that let's you discover the latest episodes automatically, you can listen to them off-line, and there are other technical details that appeal to the (eventually old) geek in me just fine.

I never really caught on to podcasts before now, I couldn't really even tell you why. Â I knew they existed, but maybe there were just too many to decide which ones to start with. Â There are podcasts for every damn thingÂ under the sun out there, seriously there are so many. Â It seems to me that most podcasts follow a talk radio kind of format, so you may have to hunt around before you find one you really like. Â Personally I haven't found any of those that interest me, however there is another kind of podcast that definitely has caught my attention.

[The Black Tapes podcast](http://theblacktapespodcast.com/) and my second recommendation [TANIS](http://www.tanispodcast.com/) are fictional serialized dramas. Â These podcasts aren't just inane chatter about whatever the hosts want to talk about. Â This is a story, written with care and following an arc that takes you through it in a satisfying way. Â The voice acting is generally good and there is care taken in production values, etc. Â The whole experience rewards listening with headphones. Â Both of these podcasts are actually from the [same media company](http://pnwstories.com/), which explains a few things, and some of the voices and people are the same in both. Â They both also share some similarities in that they are just ever so slightly creepy. Â If you want to try one, I would start with The Black Tapes since I find it to be slightly more accessible in nature. Â It's a paranormal-flavoured story line, but the overall arc is reallyÂ good, the characters are great, and I'm hooked. Â Season 2 begins soon, you might have time to get through the first season before it starts.

TANIS is quite a bit different, it's definitely got a bit more of an X-Files theme to it. Â It's weirder, darker, and cooler. Â It's also newer so it has a little further to go before I can say for sure which one I like better. Â I'm actually leaning towards TANIS at this point, we will see.

Also, if you do like what you hear you can support them via [Patreon ](https://www.patreon.com/theblacktapespodcast?ty=c)Â (The Black Tapes link)Â as well, which I have done because that is also the kind of old geek I am auditioning for. Â Why I am compelled to support and pay for things I enjoy that are generally available on the Internet for free is the topic of another, probably lengthy blog post.

There you go people, grab these things for a listen and tell 'em old Court sent ya.
