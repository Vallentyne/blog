Looks like little man Quinn will be receiving his second visit from the never tiring Tooth Fairy tonight.  Yes, he has in fact lost his second tooth.  Now there is a big gap in the bottom row right smack dab in the front of his mouth.  Two in a row.  He's still as cute as ever!  A picture will come soon!

Poppy will have to pass his old nick-name for Jordy down to Quinn.  I can hear him now... "Gid'day Picket Fence, how are ya now?"

**Update:

As promised, photographic proof of the event:
