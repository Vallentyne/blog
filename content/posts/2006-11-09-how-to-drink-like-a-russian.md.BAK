A neat post on a blog called [How to in 7 Seconds](http://howtoin7seconds.blogspot.com) about how to drink vodka without getting drunk.  I can't tell you if this works or not since it all sounds like a recipe for disaster to me, but it still may be helpful to some.  Some salient points:

Yikes, that's probably partying a bit harder than I would be comfortable with.  The main point of eating a lot of food while drinking is certainly a good idea no matter what you are having though.  The Russian party etiquette parts are really interesting though, and it would be a huge amount of fun to have a traditional Russian party night chez Vallentyne's sometime.  Anybody in for some straight vodka shots?

Hm, this also reminds me of a [recent post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/10/04/comrade-pour-me-another/) about Russians and vodka...
