A new Vallentyne landed in our house this week.Â  There was much discussion beforehand and many rules were established.Â  In the end a quick allowance advance was required.Â  Wednesday night Happy Vallentyne landed at our place.Â  What he is I won't say until I can get a picture up here (many have been taken, I'm just at work and don't have any at the moment).

One story I will share that won't spoil the surprise.Â  Needless to say Harvey has taken a keen interest in the addition of another creature to the household.Â  A greatly heightened level of attention, you could say.Â  There have been lots of Harvey tongue baths administered, and even once a half hearted attempt at a nibble.Â  Harvey wasÂ aÂ  little embarrassed when that happened, I really think he thought no one would notice if he just tasted a tiny bite of Jordy's new pet.Â  Anyway, Harvey got what he was after since Happy is quite prone to depositing samples for Harvey to check out.Â  Happy was on our bed for a minute and Harvey was sniffing and whuffing mightily to get closer to him.Â  Nature called and Happy left a present on the bed which Harvey instantly reeled in from the side of the bed with a scoop of the tongue.Â  We absolutely all started retching and were completely grossed out.Â  Harv didn't even have the grace to look embarrassed.Â  I believe that Harvey is now convinced Happy is there purely for his enjoyment, a sort of living Pez dispenser, wonderful to smell, tastes ok, and leaves behind treats, er treats behind.Â  It's a win win win for Harvey.

It's the circle of life, people.Â
