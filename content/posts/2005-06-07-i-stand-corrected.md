It was Wilson with whom I was talking (is that proper English? wait, do I care?) about the Maurice Sendak book.  He reminded me today that I'm dumb.

Mr. Wilson also informed me that Hollywood will be [creating a movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386117/) based on this very same book.  I'm not sure what to think of that, although Tom Hanks is involved, so usually that's not too bad.

thanks Wilson.  By the way, go and check out Wilson's photography website, [RobertWilsonPhoto.com](http://RobertWilsonPhoto.com).  I would give you a link to one or two of my favourites, but Mr. Fancy-Flash-pants can't bring himself to use HTML or anything that is easy to link to.
