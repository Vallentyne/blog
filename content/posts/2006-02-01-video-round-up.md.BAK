Sharing some of the dumber things I have seen in the last while, late as usual.

I can't decide who the joke is on in [this music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch.php?v=Gi2CfuqcUGE); David Hasselhoff, or me.  Either way, it's very very funny.  If he is playing this straight, then surely he must have realized that he was making an incredibly bad video.  If not, well then it's still rather weird, with the flying and the angels and the fish in his mouth.  One thing is for sure, this guy is looking very well preserved for his age.

More Youtube fun, what is billed as a bit from SNL, another music video, [Young Chuck Norris](http://www.youtube.com/w/Young-Chuck-Norris---SNL?v=NBSpNPzVsMM).  The performance makes this funny, really.

That's it for video for now.
