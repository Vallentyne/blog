Jordy wrote this very good short story for school last night and I liked it so much I thought I would get it posted right away.  It shows her sense of humour and drama well, I think.  Can you tell where Nikki's influence appears in this story?  :-)

Here it is in it's original form:


            **The Glass Angel**
It was Christmas Eve and Lucy Brown was very excited. She hung her stocking up on the wall next to her bed and fell fast asleep. In her dream, she thought of all the lovely things that Santa would bring her.

        When Lucy woke up, she looked in her stocking and found nothing but a silver box. It was very shiny, with a star on the lid. She opened it to find a glass angel praying on her knees with a haylo above her head. The angel shimmered when the light struck it with its powerful beam. It looked as if the angel actually winked at Lucy.

Lucy felt as though that their was a bit of Christmas magic in that particular angel.  She felt special. At that very moment, Lucy raced down the stairs to see her mother at the bottom. Lucy said, â€œMom my glass angel winked at me.â€ Lucyâ€™s mom didnâ€™t believe her. Her angel didnâ€™t even shimmer or shine for Lucyâ€™s mom. What is wrong with this angel? Lucy thought. She wonâ€™t even shimmer nor shine. Lucy slowly went up the stairs and looked at the angel. The angel seemed to of winked at Lucy again. Lucy was happy to know that the angel actually was winking at her and it wasnâ€™t her imagination. Lucy put the angel back into the silver box and carefully tucked the box back into the stocking. Lucy headed down the stairs and started to talk to her mother, while her sister Emma was sneaking up the stairs into Lucyâ€™s room. Emma took Lucyâ€™s angel and started down the stairs with the angel. Emma tripped and the angel crashed to the ground and broke in half. Lucy heard a bang and so she started to go up the stairs and the first thing she saw was a broken angel on the stairs. Lucy grabbed the two parts of the angel and stormed up the stairs crying. Lucyâ€™s mom shot Emma an if you donâ€™t say your sorry I will give you something to cry about face. Emma raced up the stairs and burst into Lucyâ€™s room and said she was sorry. Lucy just pushed her sister out of her room and slammed the door. Lucy stared at the angel in amazement as the angel started to put its self together. Lucy thought this was all a dream come true. Lucy called her mom and sister into her room and showed them how her angel put herself together. Her mother just stared in amazement. Then Lucy said, â€œ I told you she winked at me.â€ her mother just couldnâ€™t believe her daughter. â€œI am sorry Lucy but I canâ€™t believe you its impossible. I am sorry.â€ Lucy thought that her mom was being unreasonable and wanted to show her mom that her mom was wrong and she was right. She thought to her self, if I get the angel to do something that is a miracle in front of my mom she will just have to believe me. So Lucy saw the angel doing a little dance on her dresser and went to get her mom. Lucyâ€™s mom came into the room and saw the angel dancing and it almost made her faint. Lucy was about to say I told you so but she decided to give her mom a break. Eventually Lucyâ€™s mom had to admit that she was wrong and apologized to Lucy. Her mother drilled a hole at the top of the angel and stuck a string through the top and they hung her on the tree where she shimmered and shined by the beautiful sun.

                               The End!
