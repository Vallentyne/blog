Stevie Harper proves he's even more of a square than his looks would suggest.  Yes, we have managed to elect a dweeb to be our Prime Minister, and he's also a [size-large buzzkill](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/04/03/canada.pot.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories).  He announced that they would be scrapping the bill to legalise small quantities of marijuana.  Come on here guys.  If you take the "criminal" out of the marijuana, don't many of the associated problems go away?  I mean if people aren't going to jail for having it, then there won't be the violence that surrounds that culture.  
I think the government is crazy for not growing it themselves or at least taxing the crap out of it.  They could make a mint and take all of the wind from the sails of the crooks.  I'm thinking that anybody who smokes it now will probably continue to smoke it.  So, then this can't be done under the guise of "protecting the public".  Certainly not, when police officers could be worrying about more serious crimes instead of busting teenage slackers.  I don't touch the stuff myself, and I certainly wouldn't be happy about my kids using it either.  BUT if I had a choice between my kids smoking cigarettes and smoking dope, I'm picking dope everytime.  I would much rather have them eating up all of my Doritos than becoming intimate with a hospital ward.  Anyway, too bad for Canada that our leader is too uptight to look past his own nose.
