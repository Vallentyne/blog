So it seems that I'm not 100% up to date on the latest farm technology, which I know is shocking. Â However, I think I need to invest in one of these beauties for Lloyd. Â That's a happy cow. Â Like blissfully happy. Â I mean, just look at this thing. Â That, and an automatic feeder, and Lloyd's entire life needs are met.

Obligatory jokes:



 	  * Beef tenderizer
 	  * Scratching your rump roast something or other
 	  * Pre-Whipped cream
 	  * Milkshakes bringing the bulls to the yard

I needed to get those out there, or I wouldn't have slept otherwise.
