I usually keep things more or less family-friendly on the blog, you never know who might be reading, but this time I'm making an exception, given the strange intersection of these stories.

First we have an [old link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/somerset/4212207.stm) from Boing Boing that describes a devout Baptist couple that were shocked to find the movie they bought was actually a porno.  But they watched the whole thing anyway just to make sure.  Ya, right.  Then they complained to the store the next day and all the copies were removed, um, for safe keeping.

Then we move on [to a woman](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1540&ncid=753&e=8&u=/afp/20050403/sc_afp/myanmaranimalstigers) who was moved to help a pair of tiger cubs that had to be separated from their mother because she was too aggressive.  The tiger mom, that is.  Anyway, apparently this woman was very concerned and couldn't help but offer (money? no. clothing? nope. food? well, sort of) to BREASTFEED THEM.  Yes, she thought and thought and apparently decided the best way she could help these poor ferocious predators was to feed them directly from her body.  There's a good idea. Stay tuned to this story, it's bound to get even more interesting as the cubs get older, hungrier and toothier.

And finally, the most fascinating of all, we have a story of a guy who decided his lot in life wasn't a lot.  He started thinking that maybe he got the short end of the stick.  He got shafted, more or less, but mostly less.  If you are having trouble following me here, let me just quote one word from [the original article](http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=E4HR2KFT2H54JQFIQMFCM54AVCBQYJVC?xml=/news/2005/04/10/wruss10.xml&sSheet=/news/2005/04/10/ixworld.html), and I'm sure you will be caught right up: "micropenis".  Yes, that's a clinical term, apparently.  
So, anyway, that's not a good thing to hear from anybody, let alone your doctor, and he decides to agree to some experimental surgery.  It is risky, and the doctors mention in the article that if anything went wrong, he would be left with no stick at all, let alone a short one.  Anyway, I guess he figures he has to take his chances.
So he goes under the knife, and let me describe the procedure for you:  remove the end of the offending member, attach it to his arm for safe keeping (wha? like they would lose it, or something?), then graft a whole bunch of stuff from somewhere else onto the aforementioned member, check on end of member still attached to his ARM, and then finally, remove and reattach the end back to where it came from (sorry about that one, that joke alone pushed us past the PG13 rating).  That sounds like a great idea....
I'm speechless.

Or I guess not, since that was a long post.  I'm stunned, then.
