A short one this morning:Â  A woman [killed her husband](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2008/03/13/4991081-ap.html) after he removed the Bruce Springsteen CD she was listening to from the stereo.


<blockquote> "I mean, who the hell doesn't like Bruce Springsteen, for God's sake?" Cooper told police...</blockquote>


She stabbed him in the heart with a kitchen knife after an argument sparked by Bruce's music.Â  Yikes.
