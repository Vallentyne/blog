[Here's a sweet song](http://www.zefrank.com/social_2.mp3) from Ze Frank about social networking, a la Facebook.Â  You may remember Ze had what is still one of the only [podcasts](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow) I watched religiously, so it's nice to have a little taste of that again.Â  He made some really catchy and funny songs on his show.

Anyway, enjoy.Â  I saw this on [Scoble's blog](http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/12/new-ze-frank-song-on-social-networking/).
