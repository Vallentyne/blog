Here's a couple of stories I found a few days back on Slashdot that sort of got my attention.

First off there's a story about a nuclear re-processing plant in London that has more or less lost 30Kg of plutonium, which is some pretty wacky stuff, and not something that should just be lying around.  The authorities claim it's probably an accounting error.  Ok, that's not too eye-opening all by itself.

Then the very next day, there's [a story about a story](http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/18/1338243) in Popular Science that explains just how easy it would be for a terrorist to build a nuclear bomb.  They more or less could do it, but the article explains how difficult that would be, the materials would be hard to come by and that the public shouldn't lose sleep over it.

Gotcha, will do.  Yep sirree no sleep going to be lost here, that's for sure.
