This is a direct rip-off from Noonan's blog, but I found it hilarious.

be sure to look carefully at this picture.....  it's very compelling.

As for Dylan, that sell-out, he'll write anything to make a buck.  Ok, I'm not serious, but the book did quote him directly telling Baez that he just wrote that stuff to become popular.  There was some comment he made about a white kid telling people what was wrong with the world, and he thought it was hypocritical.  Of course I think they were breaking up at the time, maybe he made it up.

In any case, it's hard to look at this era of his career and take it seriously when the book ended before he wrote The Hurricane, for instance.  I guess the author didn't want to address that to closely since it probably didn't fit with his theory.

by the way, thanks for the book Gibson.  Want to borrow it now?

And the sub-basement is treating me just fine, thank you.  My skin has a rugged green hue, bathed in healthful fluorescent light.  It's doing me a world of good down here.
