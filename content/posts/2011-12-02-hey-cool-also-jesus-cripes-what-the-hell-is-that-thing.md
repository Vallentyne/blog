One thing that has always bothered me when scientists discover a truly badass scary new thing living on this world and they say, it's habitat is now limited to a small area of so-and-so place, how can we be sure that this frigging nightmare terror is on the decline, and not just finished CONQUERING it's little corner of Out-of-the-way-Land, and is thinking of expanding it's empire?Â  It would kinda suck in three years when we all live on floating rafts with Kevin Costner because the entire Earth is covered with ravenous giant insects and we look back and say, you know, dang it, we could have avoided all of this with a single well placed napalm strike of that little isolated valley?Â  Pass the sea cucumber, Kevin.

Anyway, here is the largest damn thing I have ever seen eating a carrot that also **isn't** adorable.Â  Ick.

Anyway, apparently this is the heaviest whatever the hell it is, it's wonderful and special and I can't help but think I want it deaddeaddead.Â  So much for the wonders of nature for me I guess.

There's another picture [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2068547/Weta-insect-Heaviest-world-weighs-3-times-mouse.html), but it won't make you forget the first one any better.Â  Talk about the willies.
