This title came across my feed reader today, and for some morbid reason I clicked it.Â  It's an advice column at the Globe and Mail, and man is it good.

Here's the question, amazing as it is, and the columnist answers it in awesome sarcastic fashion.


<blockquote>My wife and I have been in a long-distance relationship that began shortly before the marriage, and has lasted for six years. She moves from one job to another in different countries. Both of us work in very specialized professions, which we can only practise from our respective locations. I cannot ask her to quit her profession, and I don't want to quit mine.

We see each other about once a year for maybe a week or two, but maintain a weekly phone call.

Recently she has been talking having children. And because we really don't have the time to be together, she wants to go through IVF. She plans to take a year off as maternity leave, and then go to work in Nairobi for two years. And God knows where else after that.

I have always encouraged her to pursue what she wanted. However, I have been asking myself if there is any point in maintaining this relationship. Am I being selfish to think we should separate?</blockquote>
