Caught [this story](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20040817.water0817/BNStory/National/) on the Globe and Mail today about how they are pumping water out of Lake Ontario to cool buildings in Toronto. It's pretty neat technology, really. The water at the bottom of the lake is "barely above freezing", and they pump it up and use it to replace traditional air conditioning. Reduces fossil fuel consumption, emissions, green, yada.  Nice job, way to go.

Too bad this is the [coldest summer on record](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20040817.wxweather0817/BNStory/International/) worldwide since 1992.  Nice timing on that one, pointdexter.
