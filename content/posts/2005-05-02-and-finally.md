You may remember Hulk's Blog [I wrote about](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/04/hulks_blog.html), which is still damn funny stuff.

Well, he's not the only cranky celebrity writing a blog:

I give you [The Darthside](http://darthside.blogspot.com/).  Yes, Darth Vaders' blog.

This thing is a much more serious take on creating some fiction, and man it's so nerdy and funny I love it.

There is a lot of reading on this one, it's incredible the lengths this guy goes to.
