Dogs and toes have been discussed on the blog before of course. Â There's [pages of dog blogs](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/?s=dog), and the [toe stuff](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/?s=toe) is also starting to rack up. Â The subject of today's post however has to do with both, which really has only happened once before that I can recall. Â In [that post](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/07/04/and-this-little-piggy/) we heard about a miniature daschund that chewed a woman's toe off while she was sleeping. Â The little rascal Roscoe managed this feat (ahem) because the woman had diabetes and couldn't feel it due to nerve damage. Â The story ends with the dastardly evil little creature being put down, for fear that his awakened taste for little piggies would result in a continued buffet every night.

How strange that [today's story](http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2010/08/dog_eats_rockford_mans_big_toe.html) is so completely different in tone and ending, and yet be so similar. Â Here's the gist for you:

A stubborn obstinate man refused to go and see the doctor about his infected toe for months, despite his wife's suspicion that he had diabetes. Â Said man drinks (exactly what is a bit fuzzy, man thinks it was four or five beers, wife's quote says it was "all of these margaritas", this reporter suspects it was both), and passes out. Â Faithful family dog proceeds to eat man's infected toe, man awakens screaming, my toe's gone, my toe's gone.

That dog is a goner, right?

Nope, he's a hero, credited with saving the man's life.

The strangest thing of all is the original story is actually referenced in this story, and said man (who is hilariously described in the article as "a well-known wheeler-dealer" in the area) was actually going to destroy his dog too, until someone pointed out that he would be a jackass to do so since the dog essentially saved his life. Â The man remains a jackass, but at least the dog still lives.

The final quote of the story is the winner for me, as is the dog's name.


<blockquote>And as for falling asleep, Douthett said he's not taking any chances. "I don't think Kiko would do it again," he said, "but I wear shoes to bed now."</blockquote>


The dog's name is Kiko. Â Which I cannot help but pronounce Kick-o. Â Kick-o, eater of toe.
