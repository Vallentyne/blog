First, you can never link to a picture...EVER...in Flash unless each picture has it's own page, which kinda defeats the purpose of having a dynamic site. When you click on a thumbnail on my site, what pops up is not a "pop up" in the HTML sense of the word. What it actually is is a movieclip with a button which has my picture on it. It doesn't have it's own file or path or any way you could link to it. 

And, truthfully, I didn't put my watermark on each picture, because I didn't think the incidents of people screen shotting my images,  and placing them willy-nilly around the internet would be as astonishingly high as it apparently is, as evidenced by your google image search for robertwilsonphoto....should I watermark my logo too?

I know, I'm a jerk. SOME of your points are noted. I will certainly address these numerous issues in any future versions of Robert Wilson Photography websites, if for no other reason than to get you off my back. But, I will NEVER get rid of Flash...at least not until something better comes along.
