I saw [this news article](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2007/11/01/4622840-ap.html), and I stopped short.Â  I could have sworn, without reading it all the way through that it would be a story about Lockrey.Â  Maybe they changed the names to protect the insane?

I mean come on, can you blame me?


<blockquote>"A woman accused of stabbing her husband with a fork during an argument at a restaurant has pleaded no contest to reduced charges of being drunk and disorderly."</blockquote>


With a FORK.Â  That's got you written all over it, Lockrey.Â  Poor Robbie didn't want to press charges, but that's just cause you were doing the whole "drag your finger across your throat thing" from across the courtroom.
