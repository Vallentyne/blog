A single mother of eight kids(!) [attacked a man](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/08/22/6535736-sun.html) who tried to abduct her daughter. She laid into him with a metal pipe, and beat him up pretty bad it seems, he's still in the hospital. I'm trying mightily to feel sorry for him, but it's just not happening.

It wasn't a completely one-sided thing, apparently he also stabbed her a few times with a knife during the melee.

Anyway, it's really a moot point for anybody that ever had kids, or thought about it.Â  I think that laying a pounding on someone trying to do that to your kid would be extraordinarily satisfying.Â  I just hope they don't throw the book at her for it.

Personally, I would have done the same thing, and not felt one bit bad about it.
