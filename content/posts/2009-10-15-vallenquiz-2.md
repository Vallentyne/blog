It's been a week since the last quiz, which was far far too easy.Â  So, let's take things up a notch here.



	  1. What dog made a leap to grab a handful of five dollar bills, thinking it was another treat?
	  2. What child once said: "Mom, is f$@k a bad word?"
	  3. What child was once nicknamed "Gluestick"?
	  4. What child once said (adorably): "I loo noo snow mush!" (I love you so much)
	  5. And finally, what dog is inexplicably attracted to the pile of leaves I left on the front lawn, peeing and even pooping on them every chance he gets?

There, that should prove to be slightly more challenging.Â  If somebody gets the right answer I will reveal one of the first pictures of Quinn in his hockey gear on the ice.Â  Trust me, it's adorable.

Right, let's hear it folks.

*** Update:Â  Sorry for the delay folks.Â  As promised, here's Quinn on the ice, looking like he means business... thanks to Mr. Ross for the pic.
