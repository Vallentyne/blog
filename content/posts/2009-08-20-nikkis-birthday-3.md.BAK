Happy Birthday to my best friend in the whole world. I love exploring our life together, there isn't anyone I would rather do it with.Â  Your incredible outlook on life keeps my head on straight, and keeps me firmly centered where I belong which is with my family and friends.

I hope you have a great day honey.

Here she is at the pub with her favourite new summer drink.

I love you baby.
