Well, I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that I am glad [this kid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKN64o-vHyU) is not mine.Â  Man, that is one bad-ass 7 year old.Â  I can sympathize with the grandmother's heartfelt desire to whup his behind, I only saw him for 2 minutes on screen, and I wanted to "correct" him myself.Â  What a kid....

In short: he stole his grandmother's SUV and took it for a ride with his friend (more than a few miles), hitting several cars in the process, and eventually wrecking the SUV.Â  He seems mostly mad that he can't play video games for the weekend.

Wow.
