Hm.
Things are quiet.  I'm still basking in the glow of the kicka$$ TPB premiere.  Or should I say kissa$$?  An excellent "do" by Ali with some very funny props around the house added a touch of real class to the celebration.

In other news, for some ungodly reason there is almost 10cm of new snow today.  What the heck is going on?  I mean this is nuts, I thought I would be riding my bike to work by now.  Instead I sat on the bus for over an hour this morning.  yeesh.

The work continues at home, with approximately 150 feet of moulding installed over the weekend.  I have it about 50% crackfilled, always important to fill in the mistakes.  The next task will be to paint the stuff, always a fun time.

Anyway, that's about it for today.  Later.
