Very very worth a read, this web comic had me laughing.  It got posted on Metafilter a little while ago and I never got around to checking it out.  I love it, now you know what happens when you are unlucky enough to catch Paul Bunyan's disease, it's not pretty.

*Update*
Nikki reminded me that Cael once had Paul Bunyan's disease (or rather Joe Mufferraw syndrome as it's known in Canada).  We got a quick picture before subduing him with "no-nuts".  Tim Horton's truly tames the savage beast.
