Apparently being drunk or tired (maybe both?) is really good for making creative, intuitive decisions.Â  The idea is that an alert brain is bound more closely by logic and reasoning, while being drunk or tired more closely simulates brain damage (I'm not making this up, read the story) and means that you will consider a wider range of solutions.Â  This is pretty neat.Â  I can't decide just how I would apply this knowledge to my regular day job, but if I had a couple of beers I bet you the answer would come to me right away....

I kid.

[Enjoy the article](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/02/why-being-sleepy-and-drunk-are-great-for-creativity/), some fun puzzles in there too.

Note that driving a car, operating heavy machinery, open heart surgery, and flying a blimp do not require creative thinking, and should probably continue to be done while sober and rested.Â  Just a thought.
