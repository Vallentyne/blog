I generally suck at cooking, but I love kitchen gadgets.  So over the past few years I have been buying [Henckel ](http://www.zwilling.com)knives and tossing the other crappier knives we have.  The Henckel knives are really nice, they feel great and are comfortably heavy.  The thing is, the Henckels don't really come with the kind of edge you would think they should have.  So I have tried to sharpen them a little bit myself with a ceramic rod kit from [Lee Valley](http://www.leevalley.com/wood/page.aspx?c=2&p=46363&cat=1,43072,43079).  I'm not that impressed to be honest, it seemed to only help a tiny bit with the edge, I just thought I was doing it wrong.  So, when I saw this knife sharpening tutorial today on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/EMS5GZG7B1EP287Z8L/?ALLSTEPS) I think it may be time to take it up a notch with an actual stone instead of the ceramic, which doesn't seem to do anything.  I will let you know how that turns out once I find one of these things.  

Anyway, in the course of my knife-related ramble today, I came across and noticed the following:

- From Metafilter, a [vintage Ginsu](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6148619596014863797&q=ginsu) commercial I remember being on TV about 12 years ago.  And from the same Mefi post, a mind blowing video of a samurai sword that is sharp enough to [cut a bullet](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3818187790122256202) fired at it from a 9mm handgun.  I would say that my knives aren't quite up to the task just yet.

- What is up with that Henckels website, by the way?  I mean the female models holding deadly knives?  One of them is wearing a [wedding dress](http://www.zwilling.com/country/ww/language/en/home), which I guess is a common gift idea for wedding registries.  The rest of them are dressed rather provocatively, and one of them has a [pizza cutter in a leg sheath](http://www.zwilling.com/country/ww/language/en/productrange/kitchengadgets/products), secret agent-style.  What the heck kind of pizza cutting does she do?

- And finally, an unfortunate fisherman was actually [run through by the marlin](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/07/24/bermuda.fisherman.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories) he was hauling in.  He is lucky to be alive, since he was impaled by the 14 foot, 800 pound fish and tossed into the ocean.  That's not strictly knife-related, but it is long, sharp and pointy related, so I thought I would put it in this now very long winded post.
