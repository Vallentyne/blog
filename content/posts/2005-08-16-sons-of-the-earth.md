This has been making the rounds lately and I must say that it is entirely worth posting about.  It's a [video homage to hillbillies](http://www.bpninc.com/evideo/video_mac_hi.mov), set to the Dueling Banjos tune from Deliverance.  Man, that's some scary stuff.

It gets going pretty fast and furious there for a while, and some of the images aren't safe for work, but they aren't there very long.  If you are curious, start hammering on the the pause button to see some of the separate pictures, they are quite unique.  The dental imagery in particular is, ah, unforgettable.

Too funny.
