Court and I decided that last night would be the night to carry out the family tradition of popcorn, chocolates and decorating the tree.  What fun!  The kids all had a great time and for some odd reason our tree appears a little leaner this year.

The whole thing didn't go down without incident I'm afraid.  I said to Court, "We have too many ornaments for our tree".  Little did I know that it soon wouldn't be an issue.  You see, if you let Cael help decorate the tree, you are usually down a few ornaments by the end of it all.  It's one effective way to purge the Christmas Tree clutter.  As the ornaments were raining down like huge hail stones on a windshield one of us was vacuuming it up while the other forged ahead with the mission of completing said tradition by 8:00PM.

I'm happy to report that **none** of the Christmas balls painted by Nanny (that contain a lot of love, blood, sweat, and tears) were harmed.  Jordy was slightly miffed though that one of her (literally 40) ceramic ornaments fell to the demise and mercy of hurriCael.

Once the kids went to bed though, Court and I continued to decorate the house and I can say with great confidence that by the end of the week, we should be all set and ready for the Christmas party.

Hope to see you all there!
