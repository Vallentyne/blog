This should come as no surprise to anyone, but apparently there are grown people living their lives as infants.  I mean literally.  With diapers, bottles, etc.  Donâ€™t believe me?  I almost donâ€™t myself, but for that we have the wonderful Internet to cast the doubt right in your face.

Itâ€™s a long, strange, sad read.  

As for closing puns, Iâ€™m sort of at a loss, but Iâ€™ll give it a try.

For crying out loud, what a bummer.  That really sucks.  

Sorry, that's all I have, and they're weak.
