I recently had a little bout of what we will refer to as "intestinal conflict".  Not to bring down the level of writing on this website (any further), I will try to avoid any further reference to that.  So, anyway it seemed appropriate that I post a few of these:

[Here's an article](http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2001/07/02/hlsb0702.htm) about a professor who writes songs to help her students remember key facts about diseases.  Some of the "highlights" are:
"Leprosy" (sung to the tune of "Yesterday" by The Beatles)
_Leprosy,
Bits and pieces falling off of me,
But it isn't the toxicity,
It's just neglect of injury.
_
And who could forget....
_
_"Herpes Simplex 1 and 2" sung to the Simon and Garfunkel tune, "Sounds of Silence":
Hello herpes our old friend.
Will be with us 'til the end.
'Cause the virus softly creeping,
_Left its genes while we were sleeping._

That helped a lot, I feel much better.

I invite you to post your own disease-related ditties in the comments section.
