Monday mornings. As if they aren't bad enough... Guess whose beautiful new CRV got crunched this morning while its driver was sitting STOPPED at a stop sign in Arnprior? Yeah.  Some little old lady driving a huge old steel-framed Oldsmobile was making a right hand turn towards where I was stopped, and she misjudged the enormous length of her vehicle or something, but the upshot is she crunched right into my driver's door. Then she spent 15 minutes trying to explain to me that it wouldn't need to be fixed, because it didn't look too bad, and see this dent on her door from 1982? Never caused her a moment's trouble.  Sigh.

The cop thinks it is damage under $1000. Those are the worst, because you don't want your insurance to go up by making a claim, but it is clearly someone else's fault, so why should I have to go pay hundreds to get it fixed, leaving insurance companies out of it entirely? Shouldn't her insurance have to cover the damage? No-fault insurance makes no fricking sense to me.  And to top it all off, he says to me after she leaves, "She was born in 1915. That's a lot of driving experience." Hmmm. So somehow I'm too inexperienced to sit innocently at a fricking stop sign? She may be a nice little old lady, but she's a menace, and it's God-awful lucky that she hit my truck and not some kid walking to school.

Alright, I'm done.
