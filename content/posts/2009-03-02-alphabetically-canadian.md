This has nothing to do with anything, I just thought I would mention that I have been listening to my entire iTunes library again so I could re-rate everything and fix up some playlists from scratch.Â  This is necessary sometimes, but especially when you move from [Windows to Mac](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/02/23/mac-nerdery/) since the library formats are completely different for some god-forsaken reason.Â  The only unusual thing about it all this time was I decided to listen to all 4200 songs (give or take, I try to get rid of all of the Jonas Brothers/Hilary Duff/bland unrecognizable hip hop artist of the week that ends up in there from Jordy, but it's a constant battle...) in alphabetical order by song title.Â  This means you get a rather, um, varied musical experience from one song to the next.Â  One thing that came to light today is that Loverboy's **Take Me to The Top** (hm, one star, thank you) was followed immediately by Bob and Doug McKenzie's **Take Off** (that's about 4 stars, folks, based entirely on Geddy Lee's fine performance).Â  It made me wonder how many alphabetically consecutive Canadian songs have I missed to date from A-T?

I'm not (quite) anal enough to actually find out myself, but it's your homework for the week to find out the longest run of consecutively Canadian songs you can find in your iTunes library.

That's all class, dismissed.
