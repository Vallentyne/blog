Morning kids.

Video links aplenty today, for your grainy viewing enjoyment.

First off, we have a stupid teenager trying to "happy slap" somebody and [gets what he deserves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x97VLJBFWuo).  Apparently this happy slapping business is what moronic youths do these days just as a little warm up to even more violent crime.  Enjoy this future prison fodder's comeuppance.  [Here's an article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2137321_1,00.html) that basically describes what you just watched...

Then, a very interesting [little segment on an acupuncturist](http://www3.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGGvBZGAhY&search=acupuncturist%20chi) who has some pretty amazing control over his body and, well, the force, really.  Be sure to watch to end, the finale is worth it.

Next is basically a collection of videos from some Japanese television show that are simple hacks for everyday problems, but the execution is flawless and very cool.

First off, [how to fold a shirt.](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4776825453418327083&q=shirt+fold)  I really need to try this, it seems too easy.  But the end result is very fast and neat.
Then, [peeling a potato in one step](http://youtube.com/watch?v=anZBo2FmaL8&search=peel%20a%20potato).  The thing here is you peel it with your bare hands.  Very cool.
And finally, [how to put on a band-aid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhklMGA01Gg).  This is probably the least revolutionary, but it really does make a lot of sense, and I predict that they will just make band-aids this way very soon.

And finally, just so you don't think I'm a YouTube fanatic, check out this [maniacal tree chipper/shredder/demolisher](http://www.slashbuster.com/videos.htm).  Good gravy, these guys really hate trees.  A lot.  

Anyway, there you go.  I stole these links from everywhere, but the Japanese videos all came from [LifeHacker](http://www.lifehacker.com), an excellent site you should all go to now.
