Geek alert yet again.




Just got Office 2003 beta 2.  I must say that just when I think the mail client can't get any slicker, it does.  I'm amazed how much better it is.




Anyway.  Here's another thing.  Why is it that the big record companies won't take my money?  I have very modest needs and from my perspective they should be easily fulfilled.  I want to pay for music that I can download and use as I see fit.  That's it.  But I've looked around and you can't do that, apparently.  There are always strings attached, and that doesn't work for me.  You can get music from bands you don't know, and I'm sure it's fine stuff but I don't really need to be scraping through a boatload of crap to find one good band or song.  I know what I like and what I have heard, and I want to be able to buy that from the people that own it.  Ideally, I would just give the artists the money but that's not usually possible.  




I don't want to buy a CD for $20 in the pursuit of one song.  I used to, sometimes, but now that I'm older I won't.  I do want to pay for music I like, all napsters aside.  




I don't think I'm being unreasonable, does anybody agree?
