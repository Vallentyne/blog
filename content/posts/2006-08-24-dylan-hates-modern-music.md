Ok, that's a bit of a sensationalist headline and not technically true.  Wired News picked up a Reuters bit about how [Bob Dylan thinks that most modern recordings are crap](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71636-0.html?tw=rss.index).  The quote is:


<blockquote>"You listen to these modern records, they're atrocious, they have sound all over them," (Dylan) added. "There's no definition of nothing, no vocal, no nothing, just like ... static."

"I don't know anybody who's made a record that sounds decent in the past 20 years, really,"</blockquote>


That's one crusty old fart, but he probably does have a point.  Some points of reference in this debate, mostly about the CD mastering process and the misuse of compression and why they do it if it sounds bad:

I like that this is not about LPs versus CDs at all, in fact even these guys will stand behind a CD as long as it's mastered properly.  I'm not an audio snob, far from it to be sure.  My main consumption of music is via MP3s (although ripped by myself at a high quality), which would probably gag any one of these guys.  Still, I think it's interesting to note that even I can tell that old CD pressings (with large dynamic range, presumably) sound remarkably better than new ones, and I really think (with some exceptions of course) most modern music you hear on the radio today sounds the same and is uninteresting.  I kind of thought it was because I'm an old fart and like weird music, but it turns out that's because most new music **really does** sound the same.  Huh.
