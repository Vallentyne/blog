Alrighty then.

Now I bring you my regularly scheduled ripoffs of other funnier blogs (which sounds like something I don't do normally, but you all know that to be a lie also).  It's either pretend you haven't seen this already, or have nothing to read here, take yer pick.

- [Falling mannequin](http://www.thechump.com/neverendingfall.swf) - at first this seems to be not safe for work, but really there's nothing wrong with it.  It becomes strangely hypnotic after a few seconds.  If the mannequin gets stuck you can drag it to resume the never-ending plummet.
- [Jimmy Kimmel's Unnecessary Censorship](http://www.jimmykimmel.net/JimmyKimmelLive/bestcensorship1.htm) - very funny and bleeptastic
- quite interestingly, apparently the commonly accepted fact that you can't fold something more than 8 times has been disproved, and in fact [this brainiac](http://pomonahistorical.org/12times.htm) folded a piece of paper 12 times.  Try it for yourself, this is pretty good work.
- if [this](http://www.gel.tv/) is viral marketing of some sort, I have no idea.  One thing I do know is, these guys were pharmaceutically assisted during the making of this.  There are running shoes involved.  Turn down your sound.  Weird.
- [really big fish](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/more/06/30/fish.ap/index.html?cnn=yes), feeds entire village on bottom-feeder steaks for a month
