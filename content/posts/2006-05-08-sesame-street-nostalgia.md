I started to write a post about the awesome vintage Sesame Street stuff that is available on YouTube, but as I started to gather links, it quickly became obvious that there was way way too much stuff to put here in one post.  So, here's a few to get you started.



Now there's a fine turn from Johnny Cash, really.  There's a surprising amount of passion in that performance, but that's why he's the master.

And of course, the Pinball Number Count, which is an acid trip for kids.  Try not having your perceptions altered after two bowls of Froot Loops and watching this sucker.  It's almost too freaky.



More to come.
