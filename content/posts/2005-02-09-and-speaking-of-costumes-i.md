..And speaking of costumes, I was going through some older stuff and I noticed this post to Boing Boing about an enterprising craftperson who is selling what amounts to vacuum camouflage.  The real problem, as they note, is just how inconspicuous is a giant rat in a dress?




[the link](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/24/disguise_your_vacuum.html) from Boing Boing




And the direct link to the [craft website](http://www.carolwrightgifts.com/cwg_v2/cwg_layout_base2.cfm?mid_sec_page=cwg_prod_detail&seq_no=-1&min_seq_no=-1&SingleItem=10216745&CFID=6742265&CFTOKEN=94305895).




That's a little messed up, as I would on the whole, rather see a vacuum in the corner than a mutated humanoid animal dressed in lace and gingham.  But that's just me.
