It seems that good cousin PJ has been busy lately, what with the recording of the new Crush Luther disc and all.Â  There is some new content on the band's [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/crushluther), which I highly recommend checking out.Â  The two new songs on there so far are excellent, they have matured in sound a bit, but there's no rough edges at all.Â  Good stuff.Â  The album will be available in an all you can steal, er, pay what you can promotion on September 29th, which I would imagine would be a good way to get this stuff.

Nice job guys, can't wait to hear the rest of the album.
