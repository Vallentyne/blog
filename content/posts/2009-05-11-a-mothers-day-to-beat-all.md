I'd like to take a second and wish all the mom's out there a belated Happy Mother's Day.  I hope you all had as an amazing a day as I did.

I was spoiled rotten by everyone.Â  Jordy was away for the weekend so she chimed in later on in the day.Â  My day was kicked off by my boys who were bursting with excitement over the whole occasion and just could not lavish me with enough attention.  The crafts from them were gorgeous.  The elementary school crafts always put a lump in my throat.  I still have a huge tote FULL of the ones that came home from Jordy all the time.Â  Her little crafts were always chalked full of adoration and love, just like the boys were yesterday.Â  It's so adorable.

The kids wrapped their gifts this year in brown craft paper and then decorated it all themselves.  We've taken pictures to preserve their efforts.Â  Jordy traced her hands.  WOW!  That sure puts things into perspective.  Those hands are as big as mine - AND they are from my once little girl, now, teenage daughter.  WHOA!  Where does the time go?  The first thing out of her mouth when she came in the door was "Happy Mother's Day!"  She makes me proud.  A lot of teenagers wouldn't notice anything past themselves.  She had some fun news of her own to share too, and she still put me first.Â  She was adorable, AND had to have a seat beside mom at supper.  What a sweetheart.

Quinn had forgotten about one of his crafts which was a pleasant surprise for me this morning.  He had other things too yesterday so this must have slipped his mind.  It was a "fill in the blanks" thing that he had done.  Here's what it said:


**MY MOM IS SPECIAL**
MY MOM IS PRETTY AS A trillium.


MY MOM HAS A PRETTY SMILE.  I LIKE TO MAKE HER SMILE BY laughing.




MY MOM CAN DO MANY THINGS!  I THINK SHE'S BEST AT tickling.




MY MOM IS SMART!  SHE EVEN KNOWS something that is going on behind her.




I LIKE IT WHEN MY MOM  is doing something fun.




LOVE Quinn.



HA!  So that means they still think I have eyes in the back of my head....perfect! How cute is that?  I laughed and laughed.

It was also amusing when Cael gave me his gift that he made at school which was a bag of hand picked candies.  He was so excited that his hands were opening and closing so fast while he jumped up and down during my opening of his present.  He was so excited - the anticipation forever building as I slowly open the bag...almost in slow motion (in his mind, I'm sure) my face lit up, I was thankful.Â  I poured the contents of the wee bag onto my palm.........  And then he ate all my candy.  At no point did he really realize that they were for me I don't think.  He was just so thrilled to get them out in the open.  He could barely talk for the HUGE gumdrop that had crazy glued his jaw shut at one point.Â  All Court and I could do was laugh.Â  Quinn partook of the unorthodox activity too once he realized it was a free-for-all.

Ah kids.  You gotta love them.  I think we must have done something right... so far at least.

Thank you Courtney for covering all the bases.  You planned for some "girl's out" time for me, for some "us" time and organized some "kids" time.  We even got in some dog park time that everyone loved.  You are the best hubby I could ever wish for.  I love you.Â  I love our family, our life....my cup runeth over...yet again.

Let me leave you with my ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE Mother's Day YouTube bit.Â  It has me laughing until I cry everytime I watch it.Â  Try to picture Quinn as the focused and task driven older brother (I know, a stretch ;-) ) and Cael, as the goofy laid back funny guy (again...a stretch...I know ;-) )
