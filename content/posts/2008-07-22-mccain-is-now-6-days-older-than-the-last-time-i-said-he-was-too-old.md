This thing is getting bigger, rather than going away. I sort of mentioned [a few days ago](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2008/07/16/breaking-news-old-fart-too-old-to-be-president/) that I thought that McCain was a tad old to be running for President, especially because he can't use the Internet, and barely uses a computer.Â  It seems that he is unusually out of touch, even for an old fart.Â  Unlike McCain:


<blockquote>"About three-quarters of white, college-educated men age over 65 use the Internet,"</blockquote>


That's from an [AP article on Wired](http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/W/WIRED_SENIORS?SITE=WIRE&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2008-07-20-13-48-29) that has (gasp!) actual quotes from people even older than McCain who rely on the internet daily. I just want to be clear that this isn't [ageism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism), you can choose to not participate in the Internet, but I think that also disqualifies you from leading the most powerful nation in the world of people who do participate.

Here's hoping they don't elect this clown, he is to the Internet what [Bush is to pretzels](http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/14/bush.fainting/).
