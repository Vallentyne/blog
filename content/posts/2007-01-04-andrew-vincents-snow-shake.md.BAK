As some of you know, I am [a fan of Andrew Vincent's music](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/10/18/andrew-vincent-and-the-pirates/).  His stuff is quirky, fun and smart, and it doesn't hurt that he's from Ottawa, and is a friend of a friend.Â  Anyway, I happened to be reading the Ottawa Sun a few days ago, and in a [Best Music of 2006](http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2006/12/27/3021591.html) article, one line caught my eye:  "Andrew Vincent's song for Old Navy".  I started wondering if that was the same Andrew Vincent, so I wandered over to [his blog on MySpace](http://myspace.com/avandthepirates) and lo and behold, there it was.  Andrew wrote a song that got used for an Old Navy TV commercial.

So, here you go, the [TV spot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEOM9RnaRkA) with some of the song.
The whole song was available for download on his MySpace page but now I see that it's gone, unfortunately.  I wasn't able to grab a copy for myself, but I did hear it without the annoying voice over and it's damn catchy.Â  Do yourself a favour and buy yourself some sweet Andrew Vincent for yourself.Â  You'll thank yourself.
