Let's see.

Bells?Â  Firmly Attached.

Spirits?Â  Rising fast.

Yuletide?Â  Looming.

Yep, it's time to talk up the Annual Vallentyne Christmas Party.Â  Check out the skinny in the link at the top of the page, or just click [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/7th-annual-vallentyne-christmas-party/).Â  There's no better time to come and hang out with other folks in a Vallentyne kind of way.Â  It's the only multiple holiday party I know of, so you shouldn't miss it.Â  You just don't hear about an Easter-Victoria's Day party.Â  Or a St.Patrick's-Hannukah soiree.Â  So come on out and enjoy the cheer, there's just nothing else quite like it.

If you are coming, leave a comment on the [Party Page](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/7th-annual-vallentyne-christmas-party/) so we know how many valets to hire.
