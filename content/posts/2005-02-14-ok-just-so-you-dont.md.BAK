Ok, just so you don't think I'm getting too soft and squishy, [here's a nice follow](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4252421.stm) up to the thing [I linked to about Ikea](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/02/and-now-on-to-other-topics-and-other.htm).  Apparently they opened a store in England and had a riot on their hands.

Here's a good quote:


<blockquote>"Someone pulled a wooden mallet and threatened my friend. One person had one end of a sofa and another had the other end. They were both shouting 'mine, mine'."</blockquote>


Good times.

*Update
I forgot to link the story.  My bad.
