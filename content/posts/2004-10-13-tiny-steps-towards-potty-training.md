Tiny steps towards potty training for Quinn today. He peed in the potty tonight, to much fanfare. He was a little sheepish about the whole thing, but hey, we'll work on it.

Strange how that bit of news is such a nice segue into me helping to promote this product:  [The Wizmark](http://www.wizmark.com/)  It's an interactive urinal display.  Here's a quote:


<blockquote>"featuring a waterproof anti-glare lenticular viewing display, pre-recorded audio and flashing lights -- is motion-activated: step up to the urinal and the unit starts flashing, talking and alternating pictures. The units are designed to last more than 10,000 flushes."</blockquote>


They are targeting advertisers, obviously. It does make me wonder what we would have achieved with Quinn to date, however. Imagine if we had Thomas the Train showing on a waterproof screen in the bathroom....

It's a strange world, isn't it? I suppose it's only a matter of time before some marketing weasel comes up with the worst possible upgrade to the Wizmark (nice name, by the way), the Touch-Screen Wizmark. Eww.
