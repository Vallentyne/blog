Google just released an [RSS reader](http://www.google.com/reader), web-based of course.

I gave it a quick spin and imported my [Bloglines ](http://www.bloglines.com)subscriptions and while it seemed to be doing nothing, they came in ok, I think.  The only thing I can say is: it's slooow.  It's so slow I can hardly stand it.  It must be getting a thorough thrashing from the RSS crowd.

The one really good thing I can say about it so far is it has keyboard navigation, which rocks.  I will keep both running for a while and see which one wins.  Betcha [these guys](http://feedlounge.com/) aren't too happy about yet another competitor.

Sorry I geekened momentarily there, I will try to be stronger from now on.
