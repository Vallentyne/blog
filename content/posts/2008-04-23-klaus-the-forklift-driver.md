Don't be like [Klaus](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdjt6Bl5qdY).

Hard to imagine that this is actually a work safety video and not a joke, but if it is for real, it is definitely the most memorable safety video I can recall.

A little gem I saw on [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/04/20/best-work-safety-video-evar-forklift-driver-klaus/).

*** Update

Â My good manÂ [Wilson](http://robertwilsonphoto.com) actually did some honest to goodness research and came up with some background on the video, which is mostÂ definitely a parody.Â  But why aren't real safety videos like this?Â  They would be a lot more effective I would think.Â  The videos that are dry and serious probably wouldn't be remembered as well, and certainly not as fondly.Â  Anyway, here's the skinny on the movie:


<blockquote>"Forklift Driver Klaus - The First Day on the Job (in German, Staplerfahrer Klaus -- Der erste Arbeitstag) is a short film from 2000 about the first day of Klaus' work as a forklift driver. The film is a parody of work safety films from the 1980s. The film was written and directed by Stefan Prehn and JÃ¶rg Wagner. Konstantin Graudus plays the role of Klaus, and Egon Hoegen is the narrator. It adds to the air of authenticity that the narrator's voice is well known from road safety films."</blockquote>


Thanks Wilson.
