Shortly after I saw [this video](http://www.devilducky.com/media/38195/) (not very safe for work at all) in which Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a complete fool of himself while shilling for the city of Rio de Janeiro, in a strange kind of Internet synchronicity [this article](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/08/schwarzenegger.tape.ap/index.html) hits the news.Â  It's a political scandal about how he said that a co-worker was "hot-blooded" because she was Latino.Â  If you do watch the video, it's actually pretty funny how awkward the whole thing is in an 80's kind of way, with Arnie telling us which female body part he is most interested in.Â  I'm sure that the appearance of the video is not an accident, it was probably carefully timed by someone. The job was accomplished because it's hard to watch that and think that he is an elected official.
