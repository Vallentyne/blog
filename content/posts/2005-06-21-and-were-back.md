I know from the statistics I get that there are about 3 or 4 of you that dutifully check this page for updates almost daily.  That is why I must apologise for the utter lack of content over the past week.  It's this damn day job that prevents me from muttering my thoughts here, you realize.  To that end, to avoid further interruptions, I will quit my day job entirely if only the 4 of you will send me a cheque for 1/4 of my yearly salary.  That's not too much to ask, is it?  To ensure that there is always something new to read here?  Come on!

Maybe I was right to put my day job first after all....
