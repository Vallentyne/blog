To give credit where credit is due, I just thought I would throw out a little shout out to the fine folks at [Dogs at Camp](http://www.dogsatcamp.com).Â  This is the anti-kennel where we have been taking the fur kids this summer when we are away from home.Â  To say that these guys (er, gals)Â love dogs is an understatement, and after experimenting with a few traditional kennels around the area before this, there simply is no comparison.Â  The dogs are never locked away, and spend the entire day running around a fenced farmyard with up to 40 other buddies.Â  Then when they are completely played out they have a sleepover with 7 or 8 others in huge comfy horse stalls on sawdust.Â  The [facility](http://www.dogsatcamp.com/locations/dog-boarding-ottawa/) is impeccably clean and dry, the staff is awesome, and the owner Cheryl knows all of the campers by name.Â  I just dropped Harvey and Lloyd off this morning, and it goes a long way to say that this was Harvey's first visit (Lloyd's third) and he ran off without a glance backwards at me.Â  Incredibly different from the first (and last) time we put him in a kennel when I had to physically haul him into the concrete cage so we could close the door.

Anyway, it's easy to complain about a bad service or business, but recognition of a job truly well done is a bit harder to come by.Â  These folks are the real deal, and they will take top notch care of your dog without a doubt in my mind.

Check 'em out and tell them Lloyd sent ya.

*** Update:

I forgot to add that in addition to the awesome service and fun dog time, I usually get a follow up email afterwards with a personal note, and even a couple of pictures of the dogs on their weekend. Â It's rather like looking through someone's camera after a night out:
