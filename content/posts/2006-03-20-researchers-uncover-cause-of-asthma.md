An interesting development for asthma sufferers; some researchers have uncovered a relatively [surprising discovery](http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/03.16/01-asthma.html) that the cells previously thought to be the cause of asthma are innocent, and cells previously thought to be good are actually to blame.

I'm interested because I have asthma, but I also happen to know that these researchers are wrong.  "Natural T killer cells" most definitely do not cause asthma, little kitty cats do.  And dust and pollen and basically everything else that occurs in the natural world.

Anyway, there you go.  What is the Internet good for if not to provide quasi-science and opinion pieces?
