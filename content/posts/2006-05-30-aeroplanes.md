Some airplane related videos this morning.  I don't really go looking for these things, it just sort of ends up that they are related.

First off, given last nights most excellent thunderstorm in the Ottawa region, I thought this was particularly appropriate.  An air traffic controllers perspective of [Fedex planes avoiding a thunderstorm ](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6886880938991195179)over Memphis.  It's incredible for a couple of reasons; first off that's a whole pile of planes landing in a short while, I have no idea how big that airport is, but man, they must be stacking them or hanging them up on the wall or something.  Secondly, aren't they cutting it a little close?

Then we have a couple of aerobatic videos.  First it's a WW2 veteran with some [pretty sharp skills](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZBcapxGHjE).  Most interesting is the barrell roll while pouring a little drinky poo in the cockpit without spilling a drop.  Amazing stuff.

Finally an [incredible display of RC piloting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gulv_bvZS94), indoors and set to music no less.  I had no idea a plane could do this.
