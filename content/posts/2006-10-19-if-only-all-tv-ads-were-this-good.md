Man, this ad for a Sony Bravia TV is everything an ad should be.



	  * It's amazing to watch, for one thing.
	  * It's inventive and fresh, which makes me want to tell people about it, which I am now doing.
	  * It's available on the web for easy sharing.

[Check this sucker out](http://www.bravia-advert.com/paint/thead/) and tell me if that's not the coolest TV ad since "[Happy Mornings](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2006/06/20/truth-in-advertising/)".
