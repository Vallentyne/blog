Ok enough about my recent Fedex obsession, [here's a neat article ](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/26/BUGL57SAL81.DTL)about the printer ink industry.  Anybody that owns a printer these days knows that the ink is very expensive for these suckers.  It seems that the ink costs more than the whole printer, or almost.  Well, you're right.
The article goes into some of the economics of the ink business.  Here's some of the better lines:

"With a scant 17 milliliters of ink in some cartridges, you end up paying about $2 for a few dribbles. Do the math the other way, and you're paying about $8,000 per gallon."
"If you were to fill up the tank of your car with Hewlett-Packard or Lexmark ink, it would cost $100,000,"
"If you filled an Olympic-size swimming pool with ink from HP or Lexmark inkjet cartridges, it would cost $5.9 billion with a B."

See how it stacks up, in price per ounce:
Printer ink: $60.88
Chanel No. 5: $44.11
Dom Perignon: $4.53
Milk: 3 cents

Now, that's a revenue model to be proud of, people.
