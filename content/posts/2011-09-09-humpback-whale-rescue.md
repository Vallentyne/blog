Not that I want to get all teary eyed and emotional on a beautiful Friday afternoon, but man this is a pretty fun video to watch.Â  Some folks from a whale conservation group find what they think is a dead whale tangled in fishing nets.Â  It turns out that it's alive, and they proceed to try and free it.Â  Pretty awesome video of the whole thing.Â  They best part is the absolute puppy-like glee it displays once it's finally free, showing some pretty acrobatic moves in appreciation of the rescue.Â  Definitely worth a watch, even if it's a tad long for work viewing.Â  Good work done there, not many folks can say they have rescued a whale.
