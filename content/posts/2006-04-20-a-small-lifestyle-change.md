I have recently been trying, more or less seriously, to kick the caffeine habit.  I was a two large coffee per day guy, but I would also regularly drink Coke, or whatever else was going.  So, needless to say I got a little jangly at times.  So, my (somewhat half-hearted) ongoing quest for a healthier lifestyle brought me to the realization that I should probably eliminate as much caffeine from my diet as possible.  Easy as pie, right?  Sure.  Switch to decaf in the morning, avoid soft drinks, etc. and I'm golden.  It actually wasn't too bad at all, especially since I got myself some new soap.

Soap? you ask.  What the heck does soap have to do with it?  Well, it's not just any soap, kids.  Check it out.

Now I can ignore coffee at will, but if I don't have a shower before noon I'm rendered blind by a splitting headache, and _that_ can only be remedied by snorting coffee grounds, or a bowl of coffee bean cereal.
