So Wilson and I sat down tonight and had a few beers and decided that we were going to make a song using his iBook and GarageBand.  Needless to say, things got a little out of hand and now I feel obligated to post the damn thing to the blog for your listening pleasure, or displeasure.  It won't appeal to everybody, but if you like rocky funky groovy urban rhythms with a taste of Starsky & Hutch, sifted over The Black Crowes, with a squirt of Huggy-Bear then this is the song for you.

I can't be held responsible for any further use of the song, and it is released under no license at all, and I expect lots of money in return.  Or, um, Rob and I expect lots of money in return, yeah that's it.

Here's the song, with our cover art of course.
