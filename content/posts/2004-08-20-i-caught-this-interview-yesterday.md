I caught [this interview](http://www.theonionavclub.com/feature/index.php?issue=4033) yesterday on The Onion (the semi-serious part). It's with Steve Earle. This is one interesting guy.  I read Hardcore Troubadour and loved it.  He's becoming quite the political activist in his middle age.  Anyway, new album coming out next week of protest songs, I'm gonna grab it right away.
