Well, yesterday wasn't so great, but today is better.  We attempted a visit to the quiet and calm library yesterday.  Y'know, the place where people go for silence, to unwind, to read, or do research - quietly.  Needless to say, it wasn't so quiet and calm once Quinn got there.  We had a little time-out, and a chat, in the foyer within the first 3 minutes of arriving. He then calmed down, and we went back in.  We weren't in there ten minutes when Quinn decided he didn't want to put the books in our bag; he wanted to put them on the table.  The mere suggestion of such an outrageous idea immediately resulted in him throwing himself on the floor in a temper tantrum, screaming.  Ok, that's fine, I get it, library time has officially been declared as OVER.  I pick Quinn up muttering threats to him under my breath, and avoiding embarrassing eye contact with ANYONE.  We check out while he has a screaming "time-out" on the floor, barricaded by my legs and the stroller.  We leave, he screams.  He then decides what an awesome idea it would be to dole out slaps on my face, arms windmilling wildly.  Picture it.  I have Quinn in one arm, and I'm pushing Cael in the stroller with the other.





We get in the van, I go directly to Tim Hortons to get a cup of sanity, and some chocolate tid-bits of goodness.  Hopefully I'll be able to suck a smidge of serotonin from them if I try hard enough. I purposely deprive Quinn of any due to poor behaviour.  We arrive home and I put both boys to bed instantly.  I get back downstairs, go to the office chair and sit in a defeated slump, and complain to Court on the phone.





Did I mention Quinn was up five times during the night before because he decided to not eat his dinner and was hungry?  To bad we chalked it up to bad dreams at the time.  Yeah, makes for a great time the next day.





On the bright side, today is a great day (so far).  Everyone is rested (mom included) and we have ventured out for a 45 minute walk on this glorious day already.  It's lunch time and we have a trip to the 'Prior planned, so hopefully that will go as well as the morning.  Cheers!
