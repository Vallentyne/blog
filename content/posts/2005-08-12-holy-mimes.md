I'm not sure what to make of this.

One on hand, I'm a heathen, and so I find this to be very funny.  On another hand, I'm a nerd, and so I'm attracted to the very dramatic and nifty flash intro to the web site.  And on the other hand, I hate mimes with a white hot intensity.

So, with all of these things combined, I'm pretty sure that I will burn a little longer in eternal damnation by bringing you this:  [K&K Mimes](http://www.kkmime.org/).  Man, I never knew there was such a thing as a mime minister.

...and now you know, too.
