So, a long weekend under our belt, we move onwards.

This was a busy one, lots of things to do. Helped some neighbours move, attended two barbeques, held another, cleaned the house a couple of times, grew a mighty scruff, stuff like that.

One thing I will mention in more detail just because I should have seen it coming. You may recall that Cael is somewhat more subject to gravity than most children his age. It [has](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/02/kids-have-been-getting-lot-of-airtime.htm) [been](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/03/well-time-sure-flies-when-you-are.htm) [mentioned](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/04/hey-everyone-lot-has-happened-since-my.htm) [once](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/05/oh-hi-i-didnt-see-you-there.htm) [or](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/05/so-tonight-is-big-bash-at-robbi-cindys.htm) [twice](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/05/so-whats-with-new-interface-on-blog.htm) [before](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/05/if-you-think-about-it-cael_108446403834317861.htm) [right](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/06/boy-time-sure-flies-when-you-are.htm) [here](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2004/06/ok-so-who-leaked-caels-story-to-press.htm).

So anyway, yesterday Cael is sitting in his [Aquarium Bouncer](http://www.toysrus.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&catalogId=10052&amp;langId=-1&productId=11917) . Now if you follow the link, it says right there what I should have thought about a little before now. I look over and notice that the bouncer is really low to the ground, much more than usual.  Quinn is fond of sitting in this thing from time to time, and so I have had to bend it back into shape.  This time it doesn't work however, because Cael's girth has _snapped the steel frame of the bouncer_.

Yes, I now know that this chair is only designed for children up to 20 pounds.  And I know that Quinn shouldn't be sitting in it.  But we are talking about 3/8 inch steel rods here people.  It begs many questions; What about the wooden crib he sleeps in?  Is the suspension in the van adequate?  Should I add some jack posts to support the floor in the kitchen where he sits?  Does anyone know the name of a good structural engineer?

later.
