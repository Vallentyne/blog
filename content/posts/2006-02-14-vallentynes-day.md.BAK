Happy Day, folks.

It's the one day of the year where it gets even weirder than usual being a Vallentyne.  Using a credit card, or having a phone conversation with someone I don't know is a sure-fire way to start a by now familiar conversation:

"Is your name really Vallentyne?"
"yep"
"wow, that's neat"
"thanks"

Or it usually goes something like that.  Anyway, otherwise it's another day for me.

But, I would like to wish Happy Vallentyne's Day to Nikki, cause she's my sweetheart.

Love ya baby.

Sorry to everyone else about the sugary overdose there.
