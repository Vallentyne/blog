If you say that title three times fast, it sounds Spanish.  It's a good thing there's no possible way that could be mis-interpreted, cause this is a family blog, mister.

Wilson got his high speed installed a couple of days ago and he was catching up on watching The Show with Ze Frank.  He reminded me that I hadn't seen any for a few weeks and I had them on my iPod already so I was catching up myself.  I saw this one about Ze playing with his Wii and it's very very good, even if you don't get the wonderful sophomoric puns, which I personally thought were hilarious.

Enjoy.
