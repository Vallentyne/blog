Raindrops on roses, huh? I wasn't consciously going for that, but it just proves there's nothing original anymore.  Who was it who said there are only 7 stories in the world, and all that varies are the details? Taking an historical view of my relationships with men, it would seem that this is true. Sure, the details changed, but the basic plot (Girl Meets Boy And It Ends Badly) has been repeated every time ;-)




Details details.
