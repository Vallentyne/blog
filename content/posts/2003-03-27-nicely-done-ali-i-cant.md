Nicely done Ali.  I can't help but read it to the tune of Julie Andrews' "A Few of my Favourite Things" from the Sound of Music.  I'm sure that's not the tune you were shooting for.... was it?

In any case, I'm continually amazed by the companies that won't move for fear of upsetting the balance, when it's already blown wide open.  Personally I avoid record stores for as long as I can because I think I'm getting hosed every time I walk in there.  Eventually I do end up buying a few CDs here and there, sometimes because I want to get a solid copy for the MP3 library that I can't seem to get online, and sometimes because I like to support artists that I think actually try to contribute something to music, and aren't bands contrived by music executives.

But if I'm not picking up some good old CDs (out of the el cheapo bin, mind you) then I'm probably downloading it.  I mean jeez.  That's the way I listen to it, that's the way I want to consume it.  It's even better for the environment for pete's sake.  Just take my money, wouldya?  Should I just start mailing in cheques for the stuff I steal?  Where do you think that money would go?  Probably nowhere even close to the artists, I'm betting.  How do I rationalize this stuff to the kids when they are old enough to figure out what's going on?  That's the doozy.  I'm a big fan of "do as I say not as I do" but that's not going to wash, I think.  Can I raionalize this?  I guess not. I'm stealing, and there's no way around it, right?

Anyway, this is just a light bit of diversion from the weight of the world this week.  I suppose I have already spent too much time thinking about it, really.  Besides I will probably be arrested soon.
