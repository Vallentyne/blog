Well, it's been ages since I updated here on the deck build.Â  This time, some changes that are even more fun to see.Â  First off, we added the railing posts where they belong, and yes, they are way too long at the moment, but that will be corrected eventually.Â  Nothing too fancy here, just lots of drilling and cutting.

More posts, and some braces just visible at the bottom....

More stuff to come, the next update should be a fun one!
