A teacher in California was using an unexploded 40mm shell (why are they measured in millimeters if the Americans don't believe in the metric system?) as a paperweight on his desk at school.  He then proceeded to try and smash a bug on his desk, and unfortunately the shell [exploded in his hand](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/04/04/paperweight.explosion.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories). 

Several questions come to mind here:
- where were the metal detectors for that little gem?  I mean come on, if you don't want kids to bring guns to school, maybe you should start with the teachers having live ammo on their desks....  just a thought.
- the irony of this brainiac teaching anybody anything looms large

The end result is unfortunate, no matter the circumstances.  The teacher lost his hand in the resulting explosion.  At least no one else was injured.  Hello Darwin Awards?  Honourable Mention, at least.
