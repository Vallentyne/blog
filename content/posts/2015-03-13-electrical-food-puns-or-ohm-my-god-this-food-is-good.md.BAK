Cael and I have done a lot of driving to and from the Pakenham ski hill recently and we have noticed that there is a particularly interesting sign placement for the Centennial restaurant beside a hydro power station.Â  Being Vallentynes and bored, of course this leads to electrical puns, we quickly rotated through the more obvious ones:

Watts on the menu?

The prices are shocking(ly) low!

etc.

However, just when I thought we had exhausted the whole gamut entirely, Cael came up with this one that I hadn't actually thought of:

You'll be ecstatic with our service!

I think that's a top grade pun right there, and it brought a tear to my eye, being the corny dad that I am.
