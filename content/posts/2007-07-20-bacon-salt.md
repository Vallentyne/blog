I can hear my arteries groaning already.Â  [Bacon flavoured salt](http://www.baconsalt.com/), you may as well just snort it directly, it's probably no less addictive.

It's just one of those ideas [a couple of guys](http://www.baconsalt.com/ourstory.php) came up with, and you can read some of their story on their [blog](http://www.baconsaltblog.com/), too.Â Â  Apparently this has the support of some vegetarians, too.Â  So, go ahead and buy some for yourself online.

Remember, salt is what helps to maintain that ruddy, manly glow of high blood pressure, so stock up now!
