I'm at home today since Nikki is under the weather.  She and the boys are now sleeping, so I thought I would post something stupid.




Here's [a story](http://society.guardian.co.uk/publichealth/story/0,11098,1303495,00.html?=rss) about a press campaign the British government is launching to get people to eat less salt.  They claim it will revolutionize the public health.  That's not the funny part, though, since they decided to get a mascot for the campaign:




<blockquote>The FSA's TV, press, internet and poster advertising campaign features a character called Sid the Slug to warn people about the dangers of excessive salt consumption.

Why exactly does a slug make people instantly think, oh my gosh, less salt is good for me?  I know, slugs and salt don't mix, but really is that on everyone's mind all of the time?  I just think it's a weird decision.  Sid the Slug.  Weird.
