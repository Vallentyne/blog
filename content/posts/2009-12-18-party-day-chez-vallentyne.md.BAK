Well it's party day, and we aren't ready.Â  Not even close.Â  Nope.Â  TONS of stuff left to do, and I'm at work.Â  Nikki is beat, shagged tired and trying to get stuff done anyway.Â  We should be lots of fun by tonight.

Still, some of us are ready.Â  The dogs have been like this since last night, and will be waiting for you, exactly like this when you get to our place tonight.Â  Don't make them wait, ok?

By the way, that is not a camera trick, Lloyd actually is now 15 times larger than Harvey.Â  Harvey could now perch on Lloyd's shoulder like a parrot, which is kind of how it looks in this picture.

Oh, and for those who may have missed it, here is our lame attempt at a party video this year.Â  Apologies to all, it was made in one take, and it shows.
