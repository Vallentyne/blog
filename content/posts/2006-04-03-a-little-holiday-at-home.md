I'm back in the saddle after an extra long weekend, I had Thursday and Friday off due to some contract silliness.  All is well and forgiven now that the new fiscal year has begun of course, and everything smells fresh and new and springy, having cracked the seal on a new pot of contract money....

I must say that the last four days were absolutely the best four days to have at home I could have hoped for.  Lots of little things accomplished, some raking, some dog poop collection, *ahem* taking down the <strike>Christmas</strike> <strike>New Year's</strike>, St. Patty's Day lights, stuff like that.  Lots of walks and outside time for the kids and dog, cranked open the BBQ (really really need a new one), it was all good.  Nikki took the time as a chance to get about 20 times more work done around the house than she normally would have without me being around.  A change is as good as a rest I suppose.

And now for something completely stupid.
