A quick link to an article on the Trailer Park Boys from Robbie.  It's on the [CBC website](http://www.cbc.ca/arts/features/trailerpark/) of all places.  The best part is where they say to make it on American networks they will be bleeping the curse words out.

So basically the show's soundtrack will be more or less like picking up the telephone receiver and leaning on the number pad with your elbow.

Still, all the best to the show.
