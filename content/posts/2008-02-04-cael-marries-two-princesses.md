Let's turn on the Dad filter here for a minute.Â  Cael been at preschool for two years now, and as Nikki and I have slowly discovered, he basically becomes a different kid there.Â  He is the coolest, the most popular kid in the room, and he knows it.Â  Everybody wants to play with Cael, and the teachers are infatuated with him.Â  I may be exaggerating a tiny bit because I am a proud Dad, but seriously there are little girls crying some days because he didn't play with them.Â  He's basically a huge stud.Â 

Anyway, his most favourite are (appropriately) two adorable twin girls.Â  They play together all of the time.Â  Later, he is going to be soooo mad he didn't know what puberty was at the time.Â  Lately the talk has been that he is going to marry the twins, which apparently they are just fine with.Â  These girls are going to be popular later in life if they keep these liberal attitudes, let me tell you.

So the other morning Cael is talking at his usual 90 mile an hour pace and he tells Nikki and I that he is going to marry the twins.Â  Twin princesses in fact.Â  It's not all rosy though, because then he informs us solemnly "But it's going to be really expensive."

Twin princesses would in fact be rather expensive to wed, don't you think?Â  However, it's a bargain for the princesses' family, two for the price of one.Â  It might just work.Â  Then Cael really _will_ be the coolest.

**Update**

Thanks to Andrea we have confirmation that twins do really prefer to share men, validating every man's secret fantasy, no matter how absurd it is.Â  Here's Andrea's twins with their chosen one, a very lucky zebra, er, fella.Â  Look at the grin on his face, you just can't beat that.
