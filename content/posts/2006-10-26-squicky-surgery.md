This is a post that is more or less giving me the heebie jeebies, so click with care.

First off we have the latest trend in cosmetic surgery which is [eyelash transplant surgery](http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/10/24/eyelash.transplant.reut/index.html?eref=rss_topstories) (click on that one, it's just CNN).  The whole idea is to give women thicker eyelashes and make them look more beautiful.  The actual procedure is as follows:

If that's not enough to scare you off, then the article goes on to say that the surgery is not for everybody, since if your hair is too curly that doesn't make good eyelashes, and the worst part is that **your eyelashes keep growing just like the hair on your head**.  That's a bit gross, and anyway it would be weird (and I dare say, dangerous) having to constantly trim your eyelashes.

Then we have a much more disgusting surgery, if it's real and not a hoax.  A Wired article is all I will [link to](http://blog.wired.com/biotech/2006/10/amputated_arm_s.html), they have the original link as well, but it still has a pretty gross picture so take care.  The story is that a man in Spain showed up at a hospital with his own severed arm which he had lost in a sewer somehow.  Rather than re-attach the arm where it belonged and have to fight the infections from the sewer water, they **attached it to his groin** until they had his arm stump clear of infection.  Nine days later they apparently reattached his arm where it belongs.  Crazy.  This reminds me of another story I wrote about a while back, [ahem](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2005/04/13/i-should-rate-this-post-as-mature/).
