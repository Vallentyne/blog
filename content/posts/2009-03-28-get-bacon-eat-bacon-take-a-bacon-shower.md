You know how when you started to learn to play guitar, suddenly you noticed the guitars in every song a lot more?Â  Well, this is kind of like that, except sadder and weirder and definitely not nearly as cool.Â  Since I posted the [Get Bacon, Eat Bacon](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2009/03/23/get-bacon-eat-bacon/) thing, I kind of notice these signs a lot more now.Â  Today I was washing my hands at Burger King of all places, and this one just jumped right out at me.

I have never felt the need to take a bacon shower, but I suppose it might be another way to enjoy it, if you were really really into that sort of thing.Â  This is the Internet, after all.
