It's a little early to be thinking about Halloween, but then again these animatronic wonders are more than a little cool.Â  I imagine you would probably use them all year round, especially given the price.Â  There's lots of engineering andÂ imaginationÂ has gone into these friggin scary wonders.Â  I saw the link on Boing Boing Gadgets and it's incredible the variety of scary crap they have here.Â  Have a gander at [these bad boys](http://www.frightcatalog.com/Halloween-Props/Animatronics/)Â on FrightCatalog.com.

From the simple [vomit barrell](http://www.frightcatalog.com/pVideo.aspx?mt=4&pn=Vomit+Barrel&itm=1001009&rte=Halloween%20Props) gag (get it?) to the [best death scene](http://www.frightcatalog.com/pVideo.aspx?mt=4&pn=Shake+N+Bake&itm=1001031&rte=Halloween%20Props) I've seen they have it all.Â  Now, they aren't cheap, but clearly these props go beyond the usual plastic skeleton hanging on the front door.

I can see Lockrey already clutching the credit card with the phone in her hand trying to decide....

For example of the awesomeness, here's a Giant that wakes up when you come close and stands up to over 11 feet tall, screaming at you.Â  Methinks you would be saving some money on candy if you installed this bad boy on the frontÂ porch....
