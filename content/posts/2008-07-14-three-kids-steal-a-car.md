No, not our kids.

Three kids from New York apparently [tried to steal a car](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/07/10/6123081-ap.html) from a trailer park (undoubtedly one they called home - was that over the Snarkyville town line?).Â  It seems that the collective age of 33 wasn't enough to actually qualify for a driver's license, and they basically played bumper cars when the cops showed up:


<blockquote>Spooked by the emergency lights of arriving troopers, the girls accelerated, crashed into a vehicle parked in a driveway and then veered across a road into a trailer at about 2:30 a.m. Thursday.</blockquote>


The subtext to note here is the fact that these three were out and about on their own at 2:30am on a Thursday.

Some good parenting going on behind the scenes, methinks.Â  They were probably sent out to get Dad some smokes and got tired of walking...
