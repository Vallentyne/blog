I have been trying to keep track of the many ways that the Earth is surely gathering herself to get rid of us once and for all.  It's not easy, that's for sure.  

I have noticed before how the more we know, the stranger things seem.

Anyway, today's entry is some video footage of [flying snakes](http://flyingsnake.org/video/video.html).  Yes, Nikki, snakes that fly.  These things cannot in any way be considered to be just falling out of a tree, they don't fall down for one thing, they glide quite a ways.  They also can turn really sharply in mid-air.  [You really have to see it to believe it.

So, if I remember correctly the list of foes in the coming battle for the planet are as follows:
[Running bats, walking octopi](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/03/to_use_what_may.html),
and [moronic catfish](http://www.techimo.com/forum/t137704.html) (but we have [those noodling rednecks](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/archives/2005/05/thank_goodness.html) on our side, so that's kind of wash, I think)

It doesn't look good for us.
