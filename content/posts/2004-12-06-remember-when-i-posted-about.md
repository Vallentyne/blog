Remember when I posted about that way cool zoomable image on a website?  Well, this is the slightly less cool, but infinitely funnier [recursive image](http://mantasoft.co.uk/anim/show.php?url=Recursive_2.swf;title=Original%20Recursive).

This guy looks like he stayed up all month trying to make this thing.  Very neat stuff though.  Try to watch the edge of the picture frame as it goes around, it's driving me bonkers.
