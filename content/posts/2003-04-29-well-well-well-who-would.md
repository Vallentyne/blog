Well well well. Who would have guessed that a certain gorgeous, lithe, graceful 7-year-old with 6+ years of experience walking on her tiptoes would do so well at a ballet competition? I'm struggling to comprehend it ;-)  Seriously, congratulations to Jordy! Well done! Also great to hear that the Mighty is about to take those first brave steps. Oh man...you're in for it now. The months between when they learn to walk and when they learn the meaning of "Don't Touch That!" and "Wait For Mommy!" are quite (let's see, how shall I put this?)...exhausting.

As for my news, there's not a lot to say. I filled 18 yard-waste bags for pick-up today and the garden is looking quite spiffy. I'm in an ongoing battle with a raccoon who keeps getting into my garbage, even though the bin has a "locking" lid. Esther got a job at U PEI and I might drive out with her in June to help her find a place in Charlottetown. TPB was hilarious Sunday, but I missed the first ten minutes (curses!). Did anyone tape it?

Peace, out.
