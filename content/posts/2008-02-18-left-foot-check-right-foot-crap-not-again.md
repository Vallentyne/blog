Talk about your strange occurrences.Â  Three right feet [have washed ashore in B.C.](http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=d83cf5c8-437d-4586-8289-a763ee0b5738&k=58864) in the last 6 months on three separate islands within 60km of each other, which is, you know, like a hop, skip and a jump.

Without _leaping_Â to any furtherÂ conclusions, I would say the previous owners of the feet are probably sorry they _left_ them behind.Â  Probably _hopping_ mad by now.Â  If I were them, I would get out of the _yard_ (think about it) and get right down there and claim my soggy foot by the fastest means possible, say, _three legged race?_Â  I mean, there's no sense waiting to see what might happen, you know, waiting for _the_ _other shoe to drop_.

Saw the whole thing [on Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/69106/missing-3-right-feet), and am pun-ishing you with it now.
