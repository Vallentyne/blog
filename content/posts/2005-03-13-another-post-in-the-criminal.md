Another post in the criminal vein, this time about pirating movies on the internet versus just stealing a DVD.  Apparently somebody has done some basic comparison (which is probably done without a shred of legal counsel or referral, by the way) on the penalties of those two crimes.

That's pretty interesting stuff, and it really makes no sense in my brain.  For one thing, why is stealing a digital version from the internet so much worse?  In fact the penalty is potentially over 30 times worse.  Do the studios lose more from a single download than a single DVD?  Unlikely, you could steal a DVD and put it on the internet in a snap.  Anyway, fun stuff, maybe some judge will realize this someday.  I wouldn't count on it, but maybe.
