I will quickly post this because it's hard to hear on the show, but Showcase posted the lyrics to Bubbles' rap on the Microphone Assassin episode.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry, just relax and breathe.  Reality will pass you by.




Bubbles' Rap




I got a grey kitty, white one, and a tabby too/  

And a big orange guy who put snakes in my shoes/  

Mad MC skills, leave ya struck, and I roll with ma kitties, and I'am hard as f---/ 




I am down with Plato and Socrates/  

And I like to get busy with all the ladies.  

Grunt, grunt/  

sumthin,' sumthin,' sumthin,'/  

Grunt/  

Up in ma shed, up in ma shed...




Ahh, now that's good stuff.




:-)
