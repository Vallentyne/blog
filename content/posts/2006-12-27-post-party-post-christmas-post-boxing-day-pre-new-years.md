Well, there have been a few items of note since I last posted.

First off, we had the [Vallentyne Christmas Party](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/7th-annual-vallentyne-christmas-party/) on Friday in the middle of the freezing rain which unfortunately kept most people home.  For the brave souls that did show up, I think a good time was had anyway.  The shooters were flowing freely and spirits were high for sure.  I have posted some of the better pictures to Flickr so they should appear on the left randomly mixed in with the old ones, or you can click through to see them, they will be the most recent ones.  Some happenings of note at the party:



	  1. Quinn came down with the flu exactly 2 hours before the party started (that's why you won't see any pictures of him)
	  2. We managed to set the house on fire just ever so slightly, but thanks to Roland's quick puffing we averted disaster.
	  3. Horrifically speaking; Creme de Banane shooters are bad, but Fireball shooters are worse.

Then we had Christmas, which went over quite well except for the fact that Quinn was only just recovering from his flu, which Nikki managed to catch on Christmas Eve, and then give to Darlene on Christmas Night.  Overall I think they all would have been just as happy to not receive that particular gift.  Lots of fun with the kids unwrapping and playing with things this year unlike past years where the first toy opened was the only toy opened since there was a laser focus that couldn't be shaken no matter what.

So there you have it, that's where we have been so far.
