The most recent Bruce Springsteen album (ok, it was released in April) is a tribute to Pete Seeger, a famous folk singer from the 50's and 60's.  The album is excellent, I hadn't really given it a good listen until only recently and it's very very good.Â  It's old old folks songs that have been reworked into an infectious romp of gospel, folk, and dixie flavoured goodness that's bound to stay with you.Â   I have no deep insight into what Bruce is trying to tell us all by making an album of songs made popular by a Communist folk singer, for professional analysis of that you can go [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger) and [here](http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucespringsteen/albums/album/9940660/review/9961290), and best of all [here](http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22262/Bruce_Springsteen_We_Shall_Overcome_The_Seeger_Sessions).

What I can tell you for sure is that Bruce can sing anything and make it sound good, and he just makes damn fine records.  Go buy it.
