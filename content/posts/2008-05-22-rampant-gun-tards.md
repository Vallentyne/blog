Almost shooting yourself in the foot (in the foot!) with a Glock while [teaching a firearms safety class](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2008/05/20/5617061-ap.html) is not a good thing.Â  It's hard to maintain credibility with the class, ya know?

More on that note, here's a very entertaining read.Â  It's the collected postings of a person known as the Mall Ninja, helpfully annotated and explained.Â  Basically the result of way too many action movies and not reading nearly enough books, this guy fabricates an entire universe where he (along with his tactical squad) is the armed protector of a mall, and is the only thing standing between the huddled masses and evil.Â  Funny?Â  Yes.Â  Scary?Â  Absolutely.Â  Sad?Â  Unfortunately, yes.
