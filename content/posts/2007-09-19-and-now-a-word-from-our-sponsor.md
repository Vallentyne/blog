Yes, I'm still blogging about the [Dukes of Hazzard](http://www.vallentyne.com/blog/2007/09/11/the-dukes/), at least peripherally.  It's hard to describe just how big an impact that show has had on the boys.  You really have to see it to understand it.  Every game they play together, even if it's not Duke-related, is punctuated by Yee-haws and Roscoe chuckles.  There are regular renditions of "Good Old Boys".  I'm peppered by questions about how the [General Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Lee) can jump over things but the van can't (but why not?).  Here's another subtle change this television program has wrought on our household.

Up until now, the lads have been watching shows we record from Teletoon, almost exclusively.  As a result, they have never really seen an honest to goodness commercial before watching the Dukes.  On top of that, the commercials happen at the end of each show on Teletoon, so the mid-show interruptions are a revelation to the boys.  Add to that the microscopic focus with which Quinn does anything, and you have the conversations like the following happening regularly:

Quinn:  Did you know you can put Cheez Whiz on nachos?
Me: No! Really?
Quinn:  Yeah, and you can put it on tomato soup, too.
Me:  You don't say...
Quinn:  Yeah, and it's in a teacup.
Me:  Wow.

or:

Quinn:  We should get this blue stuff for the bathroom.
Me: Oh yeah?
Quinn: Yeah, you can use it to clean the tub.  It's got a narrow tip so it can reach tight corners.
Me: Huh.

or inexplicably:

Quinn:  I want to get the makeup that doesn't clog your pores.

Keep in mind that these helpful anecdotes are thrown in randomly and regularly in conversation, and they never fail to crack Nik and I up.
