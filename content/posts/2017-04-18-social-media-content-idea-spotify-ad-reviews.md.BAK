Here's a thought that I haven't really worked all the details out on, done any research for, or looked to see if anyone has done it before: Â start a review website that ONLY reviews Spotify Ads that are played for cheap people like me that don't pay for the premium service. Â Here's a starter:

For the ad that plays advertising Spotify premium itself, there's a guy and a girl ostensibly trying to find a song they agree on, she is sampling songs and he is giving his rapid reviews: "skip, skip, yeah I like that one". Â He later whines; "Dude just pick a song."

In my opinion, he is a jerk.

That's it.

Gold-plated idea, right there. Â Internet, do your thing.
