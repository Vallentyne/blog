Well, well well.  Noonan has his own blog eh?  Too proud to play with the rest of us eh?  Mr Uppity Pants and his secret blog.  Wait a minute, Wilson got an invite, wtf?

Interestingly, and probably illegally, if you replace the "www" with "archive" in links to the New York Times site you don't have to register.  How do I know this?  Why do I know this?
