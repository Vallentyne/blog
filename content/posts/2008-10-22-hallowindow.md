I have a problem. Â Recently IÂ decided that I have a need to scare the pants off of the children in our neighbourhood. Â Perhaps even to deeply emotionally scar them, hopefully for life. Â Fortunately, I have help this year.

After seeing a post on Neatorama plugging a cool DVD to project in the front window of your house, I resolved that we would do this at our place this year for Halloween. Â [Hallowindow](http://hallowindow.com/) to the rescue, the darkest dreams of any child will be visible through our front window. Â I love this damn thing, I can't wait for my DVD to arrive.

My only real issue is getting the thing up and running without sending my own children scurrying for cover.

Mark Gervais is the guy behind it, and that's the best part, he's a one man show. Â There's no faceless corporation, it's just him and his PC. Â I got an email from him personally to let me know he had mailed my DVD, it was a super nice touch. Â I hope he makes a few bucks, and keeps making new DVDs each year, it's a blast.

I actually notice that the DVDs are sold out now for this year, I assume that means he had a good response...

I should mention that I am also relying on the generosity of Kate and Marty who are donating the projector to make this neighbourhood abuse possible,
